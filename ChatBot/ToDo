-Description Key Words not sufficiently weighted. Idea: Seperate filter to exclusively filter for key words
-Chat back, advise chatgpt to ask questions / answer questions (does not have direct access to DB, cannot answer questions about hikes)
-Hybrid Approach. Coded fuzzy matching, keyword based matching, cosine similarity calculation. Look into amazon personalize once user data is available

-Coded Chat Back function New Todos:
-Let user specify importance of region. If unimportant, much much more focus on description matching
-Ask user for many more criteria than right now. User does not know he can ask for e.g. max altitude or for being allowed to bring pets
