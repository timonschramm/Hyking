Sturdy boots with grippy soles are worth a try. Finally enjoy taking beautiful 360 degree photos of the whole region.</p>",

            "description_long": "<p>For road cyclists, this pass is a real challenge as they battle their way through the impressive mountains of the province of Salzburg in Austria. At an altitude of 1738 metres, the Radstädter Tauernpass connects the Schladminger Tauern in the east with the Radstädter Tauern in the west, opening the door to an unforgettable adventure on a road bike.</p>.\n<p>As road cyclists struggle further up the pass, they are rewarded with spectacular views with every turn of the pedal. The craggy rock faces of the Niedere Tauern rise majestically above them as they make their way along the challenging route. In total, an impressive 908 metres of altitude have to be conquered on the 20.2 kilometres to the top of the pass, with an average gradient of 4.4 %. But there are two ramps in particular that demand everything from the riders: The first ramp stretches over 400 metres with a gradient of 10 %, and the second ramp stretches over 500 metres with gradients between 10 and 13 %. This is where the true strength and endurance of road cyclists is put to the test.</p>\n<p>While the legs burn and the breath becomes heavy, the air fills with the pure energy of the Alps. The untouched nature, the clean mountain air and the silence of the surrounding mountains are the ideal companion for this challenging road bike tour. Every pedal brings the riders closer to their destination, the top of the Radstädter Tauern Pass.</p>\n<p>On reaching the summit, a world of fulfilment and pride opens up to the road cyclists. The view from the top of the pass offers a 360-degree view of the majestic Alpine peaks and rewards the effort of the challenging route.</p>",

            "description_long": "<p>Despite its prominence as you travel up the Rappental (valley) from Faistenoy - and from other locations - the Linkerskopf comes across as a fairly overlooked and unloved peak in comparison to its neighbours.  </p>\n<p>Having bypassed it myself on so many occasions, I'm glad to be able to say I finally took the time to go up to the top - and I very much enjoyed the trip. </p>\n<p>What starts as a wander up benign grassy flanks eventually gives way to a steeper and rockier upper section that requires some light scrambling (UIAA I) before you reach the ridge of the summit and the two small crucifixes that mark a successful ascent. From the top, you can enjoy a largely uninterrupted view all the back down to Oberstdorf and beyond, as well as the spectacular ridgelines to the west and east.  Looking south you will see the nearby Rappensee, the outline of Germany's southernmost peak (the Biberkopf), and beyond that, the Lechtal Alps.</p>\n<p>The first section of the route follows the extremely well-trodden path from Faistenoy to Enzianhütte via Einödsbach, which I tried to get through as quickly as possible. Maps do not provide an officially marked trail up the Linkerskopf itself, but I discovered on my way up that there are in fact traces of a trail, though these completely disappear in places. I tracked my hike, so the route I'm providing is a pretty faithful recreation of what I consider to be the optimal approach. </p>\n<p>In all, I'd say this was a very satisfying trip and a fun way to spend my Sunday morning. I hope you enjoy it too.  </p>",

Doch die Ruhe währt nicht lange, denn bald darauf stehen uns erneut steilere Rampen bevor, die unseren Puls rasch ansteigen lassen. Es ist eine Testphase für unsere Ausdauer und Willenskraft, während wir uns den steilen Anstiegen mit Entschlossenheit stellen.</p>\n<p>Der Ort Damüls markiert einen Wendepunkt auf unserer Rennradstrecke und leitet einen weiteren herausfordernden Abschnitt ein. Mit einer Steigung von 12 Prozent geht es von hier aus weiter bergauf, wobei jeder Tritt in die Pedale uns dem Gipfel des Furkajochs näher bringt. Es erfordert Durchhaltevermögen und eine kluge Kräfteaufteilung, um diese steile Etappe zu meistern und den stolzen Moment des Gipfelerreichens zu erleben.</p>\n<p>Die letzten 5 Kilometer der Strecke zum Furkajoch werden uns mit einer flacheren Steigung belohnen, die uns ermöglicht, noch einmal tief durchzuatmen und die atemberaubende Aussicht auf die umliegende Landschaft zu genießen. Jeder Pedaltritt bringt uns näher an die Passhöhe heran, während wir die pure Freude des Rennradfahrens und den Triumph über die Herausforderungen spüren, die wir auf dem Weg überwunden haben.</p>",

A spectacular racing bike route that requires both technical finesse and physical endurance.</p>\n<p>A proud 1255 metres of altitude await us over a distance of 19.5 kilometres, with an average gradient of 5.9 percent. The route to the Furkajoch lets us know right from the start that it has its work cut out for it. In the first third of the route, challenging gradients of 5 to 8 percent await us, testing our muscles and speeding up our breathing. Here it is important to find a rhythm and manage your strength wisely in order to successfully complete the climb.</p>\n<p>After the demanding start, we are allowed to breathe a little easier in the second third of the course. With a rather flat gradient of 3.8 percent, we get a welcome breather. It is important to take this opportunity to recover and recharge our batteries. The gentle ride allows us to fully enjoy the surrounding scenery and admire the beauty of nature as we prepare for the final section of the challenge.</p>\n<p>And then comes the final part of the route, which requires all our courage and determination. With gradients of up to 14 percent, we are pushed to our limits and our bodies are put to the test. Every breath, every pedal revolution and every fibre of our muscles counts here. But the view of the summit goal, the Furkajoch, spurs us on and gives us the strength to master the last metres. The pride and joy we feel when we reach the top of the pass are indescribable.</p>\n<p>The road bike route to the Furkajoch is a true challenge, demanding us both physically and mentally. It is a journey that pushes us to our limits, but also rewards us with the beauty of the alpine landscape. The combination of strength, endurance and willpower make racing cycling an extraordinary experience that makes us feel connected to nature and inspires us to reach new heights.</p>",

The gradient begins directly after the toll station and reaches a maximum of 12% in some places. The 2-kilometre-long cul-de-sac to the Edelweißspitze, which has gradients of up to 14%, is also a particular challenge for racing cyclists.</p>\n<p>Not only the route itself, but also the landscape through which it leads is breathtaking. On the way, you pass the Fuscher Törl and the Hochtor before finally reaching the top of the pass. From here you have a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains and valleys.</p>\n<p>The Grossglockner High Alpine Road also has a long tradition in cycling. There was already a mountain finish on the Kaiser-Franz-Josefs-Höhe during the Giro d'Italia in 1971. Many racing cyclists use the route as a training and competition route and set themselves the challenge of completing the route as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>All in all, the Grossglockner High Alpine Road is an unforgettable experience for every racing cyclist. The combination of a challenging route and spectacular scenery makes it one of the most popular road bike routes in Austria.</p>",

There are a couple of steeper sections (no overhangs) that require the use of some artificial placements/pins, but as long as you're reasonably strong, don't have a problem with heights, and know how to use your gear, these should not pose a problem. The duration of the climb also depends on you.

The walk on the route includes several sections of stairs but there are several benches along the way as well as a wooden gazebo with benches and a table where you can have a light meal.<br/> Those who choose to complete the circular route will pass by a wonderful local restaurant where there is a fun playground for children (note that it is closed on Wednesday-Thursday). You can start the route from two parking lots - the route shown here is from the lower parking lot (called: Gunzesrieder Säge).</span></p><p style=\"direction: rtl;;text-align:left;direction:ltr\"> <strong>The route is not accessible to strollers or wheelchairs.</strong></p>",

From there, you work your way through ever-decreasing vegetation before making your final ascent up the rocky slopes to the summit.  </p>\n<p>Granted, things can get busy up there, as the Hohes Licht is the first peak (depending on which direction you come from) of the now rather over-subscribed Heilbronner Weg, so if you prefer fewer people on the trail,  you might want to give some extra thought to when best to go.  You just have to keep in mind that the huts start spitting out their occupants pretty early in the morning, especially during the summer. </p>\n<p>However and whenever you choose to visit, fantastic views are assured throughout the day (weather permitting) and plenty of calories will be burned along the way. Encounters with cheeky marmots are also pretty much guaranteed on the grassy slopes surrounding the Rappensee.</p>",

Hier wechselst der Untergrund und über einem gut befestigten Kies- und Schotterweg geht es weiter zur Dietersbach Alpe. Der Ausblick Richtung Talende ist atemberaubend und jede Anstrengung wert. Zwischendurch begegnen einem auch gerne mal eine ganze Herde Kühe, die aber an Wanderer und Biker gewöhnt sind. Die Dietersbach Alpe liegt am Ende des Dieterbachertals, unterhalb des Höfats. Ab hier geht es nur noch zu Fuß weiter.  Eine Einkehr lohnt sich, die Dietersbach Alpe bietet selbstgebackenen Kuchen, Brotzeit mit Produkten aus eigener Herstellung und frische Milchprodukte wie Buttermilch und Quark mit Früchten. Zurück geht es über den selben Weg. Es geht wieder über Gerstruben und den Asphaltweg runter ins Trettachtal. Unten angekommen, geht es links weiter Richtung Christlessee und am Golfplatz vorbei zurück nach Oberstdorf.",

            "description_long": "<p>Diese 10 km Jogging-Runde in Kempten startet im Herzen der Stadt und führt dich zunächst entlang der Iller zum Illerwehr. Hier überquerst du mit herrlichem Ausblick den Fluss. Auf der anderen Flussseite lässt du schon bald das Stadtleben hinter dir und tauchst in die Natur ein. Der Weg führt dich durch den Landschaftspark Engelhalde, wo dich weite Grünflächen und frische Luft erwarten. Weiter geht es Richtung Bachtelweiher, einem idyllischen See, der sich perfekt zum kurzen durchschnaufen oder auch einer frischen Abkühlung und Genießen der Umgebung eignet. Die Strecke bietet eine angenehme Mischung aus urbanen Abschnitten und ruhigen Naturpfaden. Dabei sind leichte Anstiege und abwechslungsreiche Wege eine willkommene Herausforderung für erfahrene Läufer, aber auch für entspannte Jogger geeignet. Der Rückweg führt dich wieder Richtung Kempten, wo du die Runde wieder auf der anderen Seite der iller beendest. Diese Route ist ideal, um dem Alltag zu entfliehen und gleichzeitig fit zu bleiben, während du die Schönheit der Allgäuer Natur erlebst.</p>",

Elbigenalp ist der Heimatort von Anna Stainer-Knittel, deren Leben im Roman \"Geierwally\" beschrieben wurde und die auch Hauptfigur der Oper \"La Wally\" von Alfredo Catalani ist. Die ersten hunder Meter gehen an der Freilichtbühne vorbei, wo die Oper aufgeführt wird. Kurz danach führt der Weg durch sanfte Almwiesen und folgt dann einem steileren Pfad in Richtung des Modertalbachs. Die Aussicht auf die umliegenden Gipfel, wie die Freispitze, begleitet dich auf dem gesamten Aufstieg. Nach etwa 3-4 Stunden erreicht man die Hermann-von-Barth-Hütte, benannt nach dem berühmten Alpinisten. Hier bietet sich eine Rast an, um die alpine Umgebung zu genießen. Die Hütte ist ein idealer Ausgangspunkt für weitere Bergtouren, darunter die Besteigung des Hermannskopfes oder die Freispitze. Diese Tour erfordert Trittsicherheit und eine gute Kondition, ist jedoch ein absolutes Highlight für Bergliebhaber, die die Lechtaler Alpen hautnah erleben möchten.",

            "description_long": "<p><strong>The route</strong></p>\n<p>The road bike tour starts in Berchtesgaden and leads via Unterau to the legendary Eagle's Nest. At 16.3 kilometers in length and 1195 meters in altitude, this route is a real challenge even for experienced racing cyclists. At 12.4 kilometers, the main ascent is considered the longest continuous climb in Germany - a must for every ambitious cyclist.</p>\n<p><strong>The royal stage</strong></p>\n<p>From the Obersalzberg, the route shows its true face: more than 700 meters in altitude have to be conquered in just 6.2 kilometers. With an average gradient of 11.5% and ramps of up to 20%, even the strongest cyclists will be pushed to their limits here. The racing bike becomes a faithful companion in this fight against gravity.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenic highlight</strong></p>\n<p>The road to the Eagle's Nest, carved out of the rock, is considered the most impressive mountain road in Germany. It winds spectacularly along the rock faces of the Kehlstein and offers breathtaking views of the Berchtesgaden Alps. The technical masterpiece of road construction from the late 1930s still impresses today.</p>\n<p><strong>Perfect timing in November</strong></p>\n<p>During the main season from March to October, the ascent is off-limits to cyclists - the regular bus service to the historic Eagle's Nest then takes priority. But from November, an exclusive time window opens up for cyclists. The road is then practically traffic-free, with only the occasional service vehicle from the Eagle's Nest being encountered. The clear autumn air and the unique tranquillity make this tour a special experience.</p>\n<p><strong>The destination: the historic Eagle's Nest</strong></p>\n<p>The Eagle's Nest, which was built between 1937 and 1938 as a representative building, is enthroned at an altitude of 1709 meters. Internationally known as Hitler's \"Eagle's Nest\", today it is a popular excursion destination and restaurant with a turbulent history. The architecture, designed by Roderich Fick, blends impressively into the mountain landscape.</p>\n<p>This road bike tour combines a sporting challenge, architecture steeped in history and Alpine nature experiences to create a unique autumn challenge. It not only demands physical fitness, but also rewards you with unforgettable impressions and the feeling of having mastered one of the most demanding road bike routes in Germany.</p>",

For amateur cyclists, this route offers the perfect opportunity to follow in the footsteps of the pros and test their own limits.</p>\n<p>With an average gradient of 11% and peaks of up to 16-17%, this tour is not for the faint-hearted. Every pedal stroke brings the cyclist closer to the summit, while the sweat drips from the forehead and the thighs burn. But the effort is worth it, because once you reach the top, the spectacular view rewards you for all your exertions.</p>\n<p>For me personally, this road bike tour is also a journey into the past. In my childhood, I spent many happy hours at the Sonnenhof in Hagspiel, which still served as a school dormitory at the time. I also often went to training camps in this area with my swimming club, TSV Lindau. The now closed indoor swimming pool in Steibis was our second home. In winter, we came here to ski - the region has its own special charm at any time of year.</p>\n<p>Today, as an enthusiastic racing cyclist, I experience this route from a completely new perspective. The short but extremely tough climb not only challenges the body, but also brings back memories of times gone by. Every bend, every meter of elevation gained tells a story and makes this tour a very special experience.</p>\n<p>This route is an absolute must for anyone who is looking for a challenge and wants to surpass themselves on a road bike. It combines top sporting performance with breathtaking nature and offers the perfect opportunity to push your own limits while enjoying the beauty of the Allgäu Alps.</p>",

            "description_long": "Der König-Ludwig-Panoramaweg mit einem herrlichen Blick auf Schloss Neuschwanstein ist ein wunderbarer Ausgangspunkt und ein wuchtiger Vorgeschmack auf die vielen Bergpanoramen, die Tour bietet: Richtung Süden Füssen City streifend bietet die Lechüberquerung einen schönen Blick auf die Stadt. Entlang der Grillmeile ab Waltenhofen-Nord schaut man quer über den Forgensee auf Spitzen der Thannheimer und Pfrontner Berge. Hinter saftigen grünen Wiesenhügeln erheben sich im Osten des Sees kontrastreich schneebedeckte Gipfel im Winter/Frühjahr. Hergatsrieder und Schapfensee lockern die Tour auf, bis im Norden der Illasbergsee, einem Ableger des Forggensees erreicht wird.\nAm Westende des Illasbergsees lohnt ein Abstecher Richtung Süden zum Nordufer des Forggensees. Von dort erschließt sich die ganze Pracht des See- & Bergpanoramas. Zurück am Radweg Richtung Westen wird die Lechstaustufe überquert und man hat die Wahl zwischen geteerten Radweg oder Wanderweg Richtung Süden am Westufer des Forggensees, von dem aus die Anmut des Neuschwansteinpanoramas mit zunehmend in den Blick gerät und ihren Höhepunkt von der Promenade vor dem Festspielhaus erreicht.",

Anschließend überqueren wir die Grenze nach Österreich, umgeben von grünen Wiesen und malerischen Alpenpanoramen.</p>\n<p>Von diesem Punkt aus geht es sanft bergauf, bis wir in Langen ankommen. Die Beine arbeiten, während wir die Höhenmeter sammeln, und wir beginnen, die Herausforderung der Strecke zu spüren. Doch die Belohnung ist nah. Ein weiteres Mal erwartet uns eine rasante Abfahrt, die uns hinab nach Bregenz am Ufer des malerischen Bodensees führt. Der Ausblick auf das glitzernde Wasser und die umliegenden Berge ist schlichtweg faszinierend.</p>\n<p>Unsere Radtour führt uns weiter nach Lochau, wo der Aufstieg zum Eichenberg auf uns wartet. Auf diesen 4,3 Kilometern erwartet uns ein wahrer Kraftakt, da der durchschnittliche Anstieg über 10 % beträgt. Doch hier finden wir den Charakter dieser Tour, der die Wahrhaftigkeit des Radsports ausmacht. Die steilsten Abschnitte erreichen eine erstaunliche Steigung von 16 %, und das erfordert echte Entschlossenheit und Stärke. Doch die Mühe wird belohnt, denn die Aussicht vom Eichenberg ist schlichtweg überwältigend. Die erhabene Ruhe und Schönheit der Alpen, die sich vor uns ausbreiten, ist eine Erinnerung daran, warum wir diese Herausforderung angenommen haben.</p>\n<p>Nach diesem eindrucksvollen Aufstieg führt uns die Tour weiter leicht bergauf zurück nach Möggers und schließlich nach Scheidegg, wo wir unsere epische Rennradtour um den Pfänder abschließen. Diese Strecke ist nicht nur ein Test für die körperliche Fitness, sondern auch ein Fest für die Sinne, denn sie bietet eine beeindruckende Mischung aus Geschwindigkeit, Herausforderung und atemberaubender Natur. Für Rennrad-Enthusiasten ist diese Tour zweifellos ein unvergessliches Abenteuer.</p>",

A well-deserved break at the Sennereistüble Dreikäsehoch rewards us with local delicacies and a moment of peace and quiet to savour the beauty of our surroundings to the full.</p>\n<p>Invigorated and refreshed, we continue our road bike ride downhill via Börlas as we glide the last few kilometres down to Missen, where we finally arrive back at the starting point of our journey.</p>",

            "description_long": "Our starting point is at the very beautiful Rötzer Marktplatz not far from the church. We drive to the main road and turn into Schergenstraße at the height of the church. This leads into Winklarner Straße, which we follow to the left. On the left side we see the signposting for our cycle route \"Nr. 9\" (yellow sign with black writing). Via Hetzmannsdorf we cycle to Grassersdorf on a small side road. There we continue in the direction of Voitsried. The signs for our route are mostly on the left side of the road in this section. Directly after leaving Voitsried, we turn right off the road and onto an asphalted field path. The dirt road joins another one, we continue to the right. When the road joins another one, we turn right towards Diepoltsried. There we follow the signs to the left. On the way to Güttenberg, we turn left to the Güttenberg Chapel. It is worth taking a detour to the beautifully situated chapel with its resting place. The pilgrimage church was built in 1902 by the villages of Diepoltsried and Güttenberg. Back on the road, we soon follow the signs to the right through Güttenberg. We ride through a very beautiful forest passage to Hiltersried and from there on to Loitendorf. On the following stretch to Trosendorf we have a magnificent view in the direction of Bohemia and clearly recognise the Cerchov, the highest mountain in the Upper Palatinate with its lookout tower on the summit. In Trosendorf, Gasthaus Decher invites us to take a break. Finally, we continue on to Schönthal. In the village, we keep to the right at the T-junction in the direction of Rötz and Cham. We leave the main road in the direction of Niederpremeischl and reach the Alte Rötzer Straße. We follow the course of the main road to the left over a bridge and turn right, parallel to the main road. On the left side of the road we find a nice, covered rest area. Here you will also find a bus stop from where buses run to the nearest railway station in Waldmünchen, 13 km away. Bicycle transport is also possible on the buses. Shortly after the bus stop, we turn left towards Flischbach and Niederpremeischl and cross the Schwarzach on a bridge. From the hamlet of Niederpremeischl we cycle into the village of Flischbach, which was the national winner in the 1998 competition \"Our village should become more beautiful\". We cycle through the village and follow the road towards Rhan. This is where Rhan beer is brewed; we can see the brewery on the left-hand side of the road. Also at our starting point and destination in Rötz, a very tasty beer is produced by the cooperative brewery there. But before we can enjoy this well-deserved pleasure, we continue via Döfering and Lixendöfering to Grafenkirchen, which we reach via a side road running parallel to the main road. In the village we meet the Schmitzdorfer Straße, which we follow to the right through a subway. At the end of the village, keep to the right in the direction of Engelsdorf and Löwendorf. At the crossroads, we do not turn right towards Löwendorf, but continue straight ahead into the forest. Soon the asphalt road ends and we continue cycling on a forest path. After we have left the forest again, a short field passage follows, which leads us into the village of Öd. At the end of Öd, follow the signs to Wenzenried and Rötz. A descent into the Schwarzach river valley follows. Shortly before the end of Gmünd, we turn left. We now ride parallel to the Schwarzach in the direction of Rötz. At the T-junction in Rötz we turn right into Chamer Straße. From here we have a beautiful view of Rötz. We turn right into Brückenstraße and cross the Schwarzach. At the next T-junction, we turn right and ride the few metres back to the starting point.",

            "description_long": "We ride from the starting point into the Breitenwiesweg. This is where the white sign with the orange stylised mountain biker and our tour marking, the white \"40\" on a red background, leads us. On the Breitenwiesweg we pass various sports facilities. We ride in the direction of the adventure pool through Dr. Matthias-Lechner-Straße. Opposite the adventure pool, at the height of a car park, we turn left onto a dirt road. This leads into a small road that leads to the Perlsee lake. We pass the lake on the south-western shore along the footpath and cycle path that runs along the dam. From here we have a beautiful view of the lake. At the next T-junction, we turn left and pass a miniature golf course. Shortly afterwards, we follow the signs to the right onto a slightly ascending forest path. Along this path we reach the beautifully situated Blumenlohe equestrian farm. Before we go straight ahead into the forest at the next junction, it is worth taking a look back at Waldmünchen. When the path joins a road, we cycle to the right towards the beautifully situated village of Kummersmühle. There, at the end of the village, we turn right just before the bus stop. The route symbol is reduced here to a stylised mountain biker. In the following forest section, we can orientate ourselves by the marking of the hiking trail \"W 11\". At a fork, we follow this straight ahead, past a barrier. A very short, difficult section of trail awaits us. After another barrier, we cross an asphalt road and continue on a forest path that is now easy to follow again. Behind a group of dead boards at the edge of the forest, we turn left onto an asphalt path. In Spielberg we come across a chapel with a very beautiful lime tree and a small pond on the left side of the path. Opposite, a rest area invites you to take a break. In Spielberg, we turn right in the direction of Gasthaus Braun, behind which we turn left. At the first fork in the road, we turn right towards the edge of the forest. After a beautiful forest passage, we turn right and cycle along the edge of the forest. The path leads to an asphalt road, which we follow to the right. We cycle through the forest again and keep going in the direction of Silbersee in Witzelsmühle. There we first cycle over the dam at the southern end of the beautifully situated lake, then along the southwestern shore along the hiking trail \"T 5\". Further along the path we pass a beautiful bathing place with a sandy beach. Behind the car park we cycle towards the asphalt road, which we follow to the left. Via Grubhof and Stein we reach the Hussite monument near Hiltersried. Here, Count Palatine Johann von Neunburg defeated the Hussite superiority in 1433. This part of the route gives our tour its name. We continue to Trosendorf. There the Gasthof Bösl invites you for a stop. From Trosendorf we finally ride to Kritzenast, where we turn left onto the Schwarzachtalradweg before the bridge and the sawmill. Behind a small wooden bridge we cycle straight ahead, parallel to the Schwarzach. A very beautiful forest passage follows, after which we reach Biberbach. There we follow the signs in the direction of Hirschhöf. We continue to follow the Schwarzachtalradweg, which is better marked in this section. At a small chapel on the side of the path shortly after Hirschhöf, benches invite us to take a rest. In Hocha, we turn left at the crossroads at the Hochaer Plätzl restaurant in the direction of Perlsee. We can ride parallel to the road for a short distance before turning right to Lake Perlsee. We reach it in a few minutes and return the way we came.",

At the large hotel \"Haidmühler Hof\" we turn right, past the supermarket to the intersection with Kirchbergstraße. Here we see our signpost \"54\" for the first time. On the opposite side we find the small Max-Pangerl-Garten, which is worth seeing. We roll left downhill to the road to Bischofsreuth. Soon two paths branch off to the right, we choose the path that leads us over the road bridge of the Cold Vltava to an old mill. From the bridge you have a beautiful view of the floodplain of the Cold Vltava. In front of the building, we turn right on Hammer Street towards the north. The quiet asphalt road soon leads us slightly uphill. To the right we see the meadows of the Köhlbach, which marks the course of the state border between Germany and the Czech Republic. Passing scattered residential houses, we head north through Theresienreuth and to Auersbergreuth. Again and again we are offered beautiful views over the mountains of the Bavarian Forest. In Auersbergreuth we leave the asphalt road leading west, we now ride on an unpaved path into the forest. We follow the small signpost \"54\" after about 1 km in the forest, it points the way uphill to the left. After leaving the forest, we reach an asphalt path by the chairlift, which we follow to an information board about the national park on the main road. We roll right to Marchhäuser, after 500 m a path leads us straight down between the residential houses to the small wooden bridge over the Harlandbach stream, where we cross the \"green\" border to the Czech Republic. Information boards tell us that we are now in the Sumava National Park, Bohemian Forest. The national park was founded in 1991 and with an area of 7,000 hectares is considerably larger than the oldest German national park, the Bavarian Forest (24,000 hectares). This is followed by the longest and most demanding climb of this cycling tour. A gravel path leads uphill through a spruce forest. Finally, at the edge of the forest, we are offered numerous fantastic views to the north. Soon we come to an asphalt road from the north. We follow this path to the right, pass the highest point of our tour and roll on asphalt to Ceske Zleby, the first village on the Czech side. Here a small bistro invites you to take a break. We turn right to Stozec - an extremely pleasant section of our connoisseur's tour. Slightly downhill on a wide road with little traffic, in the midst of a varied landscape, we reach the information centre of the Czech Sumava National Park after 1 km. We continue downhill to Stozec, another small village. Behind the restaurant we turn right. We follow the signs to Nove Udoli. The narrow road winds through forest at times. This is how we reach Nove Udoli. Now the border is not far away. Directly before the border crossing, the former railway line ends on the Czech side, which 100 years ago continued to Waldkirchen and has now been converted into a cycling and hiking path, the Adalbert Stifter Cycle Path. Information boards remind us of the time when trains still ran from Bavaria to Bohemia. Behind the customs house, we pass the large hikers' car park on the German side and cycle slightly uphill to Haidmühle, where we can finish our two-country tour in the restaurant of the Haidmühler Hof.",

Another species that is no longer unknown in these latitudes is the climber, who finds a natural recreational and training environment here in the greater Stuttgart area.

            "description_long": "This ski tour to the Brecherspitz (1683 m) from Neuhaus offers alpine pleasure and an enjoyable descent in high and very safe snow conditions. However, the ascent requires stamina despite the shortness. The orientation of the slopes of the ascent and descent route is predominantly northerly. The avalanche danger can be very high depending on the snow conditions, which means that for this tour we absolutely need very stable conditions. Orientation is easy in good visibility. However, missing tracks and poor visibility can quickly turn orientation into a challenge. The ascent to the summit on the north ridge requires surefootedness and a head for heights. Snow cornices can make this section dangerous. The descent takes place in the uppermost area on an extremely steep section. The appropriate skiing ability is therefore a prerequisite.\n<p> </p>",

We leave Oberstetten on the Reutalweg and follow the idyllic Reutalbach stream past the Reutalmühle mill to Wildentierbach. Here we can visit a village detention cell from the 19th century in the gate tower of the fortified church. We hike north along the \"Wildentierbach\" road and shortly after Dunzendorf reach the natural bathing lake in Rinderfeld - a good opportunity for a refreshing swim in fine weather. At the nearby country road to Rinderfeld, we turn briefly left and then hike immediately right into a wooded area. After a short stretch across fields, we enter a second piece of woodland where there is a Celtic square enclosure. The Celtic redoubt, which is over 2000 years old, is one of 70 such ramparts in Baden-Württemberg and probably served as a sacrificial site.

Shortly after the turnoff to Fürstenzell, we then continue to the right on a gravel path. Soon we reach Haunreut. There we keep sharp right in the direction of \"Haunreut 10\". From here we walk past numerous apple trees on a meadow path and finally come across a wider field path again. We turn right onto this and reach an asphalt road again shortly before the Sieberhof. We keep to the left, again following the white-green marking \"10\", and hike up to Rehschaln. Immediately after entering the village, we turn right onto a gravel path. Follow this to the fork in the road and then continue uphill to the left. A little later you will reach the main road, cross it and continue on the other side to the left on the footpath to the granite church of Rehschaln (1). Behind this church, we then turn right towards Irsham, again following the white-green markings. We hike down to Oberirsham and turn sharp left onto a field path. Cross the Gurlarner Bach stream and shortly afterwards you will come to an asphalted road again at Untereichet. Turn left there and climb up to Langdobl. Here we have the opportunity to replenish our provisions with farm produce at the Haindlhof cheese dairy (2). Our path then continues uphill to the through road. We turn left onto this and hike straight ahead to Gföhret. From here we can now enjoy the view down to Fürstenzell, but also into the Danube valley and up to the mountains of the Bavarian Forest. Shortly after leaving the village, we turn right onto a grassy forest path. This leads us up to the \"Platte\" (3) in Altenmarkt - the highest point of our tour. Here we can not only enjoy the impressive view again, but also fortify ourselves at the \"Zur Platte\" inn. Finally, we follow the asphalt road first downhill to the left, but then turn right onto a meadow path, again following the white-green markings \"10\" and now also \"14\". Our path leads us through the forest for a bit until we come across a wider forest path again, which we turn left onto. After a few metres we reach a small rest area on the through road. Here we continue a few steps to the left and then cross the road. We walk straight ahead into the forest again, following the green and white signposting \"14\" in the direction of Heiligenbrunn. After about 300 m, we turn left onto a forest path overgrown with gnarled tree roots. Finally, we reach another crossroads at the so-called Jägersteig and turn left here. At the asphalt road, we keep to the right, cross the Laufenbach stream and then continue to the right on the forest path. At the first fork, we leave the route with the green and white marking \"14\" and choose the path to the right until we reach a clearing. There we walk to the left along the edge of the forest until we reach the pilgrimage chapel Heiligenbrunn (4). At the crossroads near the car park, keep to the left. Our path now leads us straight ahead through the forest. Finally, at a wide fork in the road, we again follow the white-green marking \"10\" and thus turn right. Via Obereichet we reach the through road in Jägerwirth. We cross this and walk the few metres back to our starting point at the church. Finally, we have the opportunity to take a short detour into the Bible Garden.",

Below the aviation monument at the edge of the forest, the Hochhöner leads steeply down to Abtsroda. On the way you will pass:<br/>- Fliegerdenkmal (926), certainly the most famous monument in the Rhön is also the most beautifully situated. It has to do with the history of aviation on the Wasserkuppe: after the First World War, motorised flight was not allowed in Germany, but gliding was. And so the Wasserkuppe became a \"Mecca\" of gliding. The monument, erected in 1923, evokes the importance of flying for Germany, so it has a strong nationalist background. - Edge of the forest - ski lift station (743)<br/>- Poppenhausen-Abtsroda/eastern edge of the village - country road junction (698)<br/>- Weiherberg (786), it is definitely worth climbing up to the summit cross slightly above the hiking trail: the view of the Wasserkuppe and the western Rhön is breathtaking. - Enzianhütte car park (745)<br/>- Enzianhütte (739)<br/>- Grabenhöfchen (688)<br/>- Bubenbader Stein (704), The Bubenbader Stein is part of a larger group of basalt rocks scattered in the forest here. - Milseburg (835), next to the Wasserkuppe certainly the most famous mountain in the Rhön. Beautiful rocky peak (fantastic panoramic view!) with an old crucifixion group (which has been here since 1756). There has never been a \"castle\" here, but the mountain was inhabited in Celtic times, as the ring walls around the Milseburg show. Next to the summit is the small Gangolf Chapel. - Milseburg car park (661)<br/>In the Oberbernhardser Höhe nature reserve, gentians bloom. The Hochrhöner runs in wide loops through the forest until it reaches the village of Langenberg. Around the hilltop of Ulrichshauk and past the sports field on the edge of Schwarzbach, the trail descends to Gotthards.",

            "description_long": "The Wine Tauber Hiking Trail connects the former Cistercian monastery of Bronnbach, the wine village of Reicholzheim, the village of Waldenhausen and the town of Wertheim on a 20-kilometre loop. It is divided into two circular tours that can be hiked individually or as a large loop.\n<br/>We hike one of the two loops from Bronnbach to Reicholzheim and back via the Schafhof. This section of the trail is marked with a \"white bunch of grapes over a white river on a red background\". The starting point is the former Cistercian monastery in Bronnbach (Tauber). On an information board we can learn interesting details about the monastery founded in 1151. We walk a short distance along the country road towards Reicholzheim before turning right on a path into a small wood. At the other end of the small wood, we turn left, walk straight along the edge of the wood and then left until we reach a vineyard. We almost go around it, walk straight ahead for a while between meadows and fields and then turn left towards Reicholzheim. Here, on the old high trail between Reicholzheim and Bronnbach, shortly before entering the village, we pass the stone cross nest. It is the largest known collection of stone crosses in Germany - 14 stone crosses made of sandstone, set in a red sandstone retaining wall. An information board provides more detailed information on the history of the crosses and the bloody legend surrounding them. In Reicholzheim, we first walk along the street \"Am Felder\", then turn right across the \"Steiggärten\", later turn left and walk out of the village above the cemetery. Our path through a meadow and forest landscape describes a right turn and soon meets an asphalt road. Follow it to the right and take the left path at the next fork. This leads us parallel to the Geißbergstraße around the village of Reicholzheim until we come close to the stone cross nest again. As our path ends there in a dead end, we change shortly before to the parallel path that runs to the left of ours. At the next junction we turn sharp left and walk straight on through fields and vineyards into a wooded area and turn right there until we reach the Schafhof farm. Here we turn left, then keep to the right and after a while we meet the country road again east of Bronnbach. This leads us back to the right to our starting point at the monastery, where we can stop at the Klosterhof inn to finish.",

It was probably already in Celtic times that well-trodden footpaths led across the North Forest. When the path was paved with granite slabs in the 18th century, it could be used by covered wagons. Because of the dangers posed by highwaymen, thieves and wolves, merchants, missionaries, pilgrims, kings and emperors, artists, warriors and travelling people travelled in columns back and forth along the path. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Böhmweg lost its importance as a traffic route due to the construction of the Ruselstrasse, but revived as a hiking trail.<br/>Today it leads the hiker in the footsteps of the old traders and travellers from the Danube valley over the mountains of the Bavarian Forest to Böhmen. Because of its relatively short daily stages and the mainly comfortable, wide paths, the Böhmweg is well suited for families and leisurely hikers. There is always plenty of time to visit the numerous villages and places of interest along the way.",

There is also plenty of time to visit the museum in the \"Fressendes Haus\" and to take a walk in the Glittering Forest.<br/><br/><b>3rd stage: Weißenstein – Zwiesel (12 km, approx. 3 hours)</b><br/>Today's route from Weißenstein üvia Poschetsried and Schweinhütt to the glass town of Zwiesel takes you effortlessly through open cultivated landscapes. If you prefer narrow footpaths, you can also hike along the river trail through the idyllic Regental valley from Regen to Zwiesel. In Zwiesel you can visit the forest museum, the Catholic parish church (with magnificent neo-Gothic stained glass windows) or one of the glassworks (and the world's largest glass pyramid).<br/><br/><b>4th stage: Zwiesel – Bayerisch Eisenstein (16 km, approx. 5 hours)</b><br/>Without major differences in altitude, today's route takes you through the extensive mountain forests of the Bavarian Forest National Park and Šumava.

Kempten is divided into two original parts. The Catolic monastery of the Benedictines with the St. Lawrence Basilica extended northwest of the residence. Today's old town with the Protestant St. Mang Church formed the second historical part of Kempten.\r\n<p>Many companies have settled in Ursulasried, which particularly appreciate the proximity to the city of Kempten and the A7 motorway. A little later, the Illersteilufer offers a harsh contrast through the again typically rural landscape. Along the west side of the Iller, factories appear again and again, but they are not perceived as disturbing because of the vegetation along the banks.</p>",

After a short tour of the town, we set off on a leisurely hike through forests and along small streams. Several valleys and natural orchards lead us past Stornfels to Rainrod, which lies in the Nidda valley.</p>\r\n<p>Stage 2: Rainrod - Schotten-Burkhards (19.5 km)</p>\r\n<p>Today we first walk along the edge of the forest with wonderful views and touch the village of Eichelsdorf. In the Eichköppel bird sanctuary, we cross several small streams and enjoy nature. Descending into the Eichelbach valley, we reach the end point of our day's stage, Schotten-Burkhards, via Gederner See.</p>\r\n<p>Stage 3: Schotten-Burkhards - Herchenhain (16 km)</p>\r\n<p>From Schotten-Burkhards, we circle a large wooded area and reach Völzberg via the Alte Burg rock formation. The route now climbs up to the Völzberger Köpfchen and via the village of Hartmannshain to the Herchenhainer Höhe - both of which offer wonderful views.</p>\r\n<p>Stage 4: Herchenhain - Herbstein (15.5 km)</p>\r\n<p>From the Herchenhainer Höhe, we head towards a chain of basalt formations one behind the other, including the Bonifatiuskanzel geotope and the \"Gesicht\". On the way to Ilbeschausen-Hochwaldhausen, we see the \"Burg\" and the \"Uhuklippen\" as well as many other impressive volcanic geotopes. Our destination is the Kolping vacation village near Herbstein. In Herbstein, we stroll through the beautiful old town and can pay a visit to the carnival museum and the Catholic church of St. James.</p>\r\n<p>Stage 5: Herbstein - Ulrichstein (23 km)</p>\r\n<p>We reach Helpershain through the nature reserve at the Schalksbach ponds and the Eisenbach valley. A little later, we reach the \"Dicken Steine\", which, according to legend, were used by Frau Holle to access the underworld. In Ulrichstein, the Vogelsberg garden, the castle ruins and the hunting museum are well worth a visit.</p>\r\n<p>Stage 6: Ulrichstein - Laubach (23 km)</p>\r\n<p>Today we embark on the last stage of the circular tour, which once again offers breathtaking views, e.g. from the Schleuningsteine. We walk past Kölzenhain through the idyllic Seenbachtal valley and admire numerous old mills along the way. After Freienseen, we leave the valley and walk through a hilly wooded area back to Laubach, the starting point of our long circular walk.</p>",

            "description_long": "Before the starting signal is given in Neuhaus on the large meadow on the Apelberg (820 m above sea level), there is singing and swaying.                It's a tradition - no marathoner sets off without a \"snow waltz\" - a unique atmosphere that is second to none.                <br/> <br/> With the starting signal, WSV Neuhaus then releases around 3,200 starters every year through the large 4-metre wide starting gate on their way of 43.5 km to Schmiedefeld. <br/> <br/> For the time being, the route goes from the wide meadow to the \"narrow\" road out of Neuhaus. Almost 6 kilometres must be run on the road until, after the first refreshment stop at \"Sandwieschen\" (km 5.81 / 777 m NN), the trail enters the forest.                At kilometre 10.63 you will reach the first refreshment point \"Dreistromstein\" (812 m), which is run by WSV Scheibe-Alsbach. <br/> <br/> Freshly refreshed, the route continues over ascents and descents to the \"Eisfelder Ausspanne\" (km 15.76 / 752 m) and from there uphill to the highest point of the marathon course, the \"Eselsberg\" (km 18.8 / 841 m) with its tower hut, a landmark of the Rennsteig.                A refreshment point has been set up here by the SG \"Rennsteig\" Masserberg and an intermediate time is taken.<br/> <br/> The route now descends. When you cross the road (km 19.75 / 785), you have already climbed 56 m.<br/> <br/> Pass the meadow behind Masserberg and head towards the next refreshment point, the \"Schwalbenhaupt\" (km 22.7 / 703 m), where the Schleusegrund Hiking Club serves refreshments. But be careful. Before reaching the refreshment point, the trail descends through a sunken path over sticks, roots and stones. A real cross-country run.<br/> <br/> Parallel to the road, the Rennsteig leads in the direction of Neustadt, past the car park of the Altenfeld ski lift. Here you have reached kilometre 25. When Neustadt comes into view, first cross the road in Kahlert and continue along the Rennsteig to the entrance to Neustadt/petrol station. Walk through the town to the church. There you turn left to reach the Neustadt running group's aid station (km 29.2 / 805 m).<br/> <br/> Freshly fortified, you can now take the climb over the Großer Burgberg (818 m). It is a steep climb, mostly taken at a walk. But it is not far to the next refreshment point at the \"Dreiherrenstein\" (Km 34.3 / 810 m), run by IG Stützerbach. <br/> <br/> From there it's a gentle downhill to Frauenwald. At the \"Monument am Bohrstuhl\" (Km 38.23 / 786 m), the Frauenwälder SV awaits the runners with a final refreshment. Those who want to can also get a \"sip\" of Köstritzer Schwarzbier here as an energy boost for the last kilometres to Schmiedefeld.                <br/> <br/> Schmiedefeld, the finish - cross the level crossing and turn left into the \"Reitallee\" (Km 42,59 / 622 m).                A final climb to the sports field at 711 m - the acid test for every marathoner who would have already reached the finish in a normal marathon.<br/> <br/> You can already hear the hustle and bustle from the finish. Surrounded by many spectators cheering you on for the last few metres, everyone gives it their last. Then another half lap of the stadium and you're at the finish. You have completed the 43.5 kilometre Rennsteiglauf Marathon and a 1.4 kilometre marathon cross.",

From Weidach, the route is oriented back to Durach, passing the sports fields of the Kempten district of Kottern as it crosses the village. After reaching the nearby Sinz bakery, the familiar dirt road is not taken again, but the bypass road towards St. Mang is followed until the next traffic circle.

It is beautiful and diverse at any time of the year, and with snow it dazzles with its beauty and immerses you in some mystery. We must admit that the castle is lonely, and inside it is said to be gloomy. But thanks to the daily flow of tourists, the castle finds the strength to create a fairy tale, on the background of which you can endlessly take pictures.</p>\r\n<p>Walk through beautiful places, look for the fairy tale, open your soul, and share your photos.</p>",

However, we go around this on the left in the direction of the boat rental or bathing area. This is where the first swim starts to the bathing area of Niedersonthofener See, further to the south, on the other side of the lake. Back on land, follow the wide hiking trail for about 1.5 km along the shore to start the second swim at a \"wild\" entrance. The crossing of the lake to the bathing area on the opposite side is the longer of the two swims at about 700 metres.

With the connection of Bayreuth to the first German North-South railway line Leipzig – Hof – Nürnberg – Lindau in 1853, industrialisation took off rapidly. The railway played a major role in the establishment and development of the textile industry, and other industries in the town, such as breweries, also benefited from a faster supply of raw materials and goods. Traditional companies such as the porcelain factory Walküre or the renowned piano manufacturer Steingraeber & Söhne complement the city's industrial offerings and show how closely history, culture and industry are still interconnected and flourish in Bayreuth today.",

However, the last remains of the walls are covered in the ground and thus protected from final decay. We descend through the wild and romantic Mültobel.

In the night of 22nd to 23rd February 1985, the inn burnt down to the ground and was rebuilt in the old style. The old sawmill is put into operation from time to time for viewing.<br/> Behind the barn, the hiking trail leads to the Schnart, where we cross the road to Niederbüren and enter the Diggetwald. The trail leads us to Tannwisen and the farming village of Niederbüren. From there we hike to the Thur dam. We often have to share the path to Bischofszell along the Thur with bikers and riders. Nevertheless, it is fascinating to follow the rushing river, which rises in Wildhaus as the Wildhauser Thur and in Thurwis as the Säntisthur and flows into the Rhine at Flaach. <br/>Shortly before Bischofszell, at the stone arch bridge dating from 1487 - renovated as a footbridge in 1972 - we leave the idyllic Thur landscape and climb up to the historic town of Bischofszell, which lies on a terrace at the foot of the Bischofberg üabove the confluence of the Sitter and Thur.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>",

From the nearby Marienköpfl, there is a magnificent view of the lake and the surrounding area. Lake Eiben, which is rich in fish, is nestled between steep slopes that keep the wind out. The water level is thus often not clouded by the slightest wave and lies crystal clear in front of us. In summer, numerous plants, some of them rare, can be found along the path, and in the beginning of winter, the first white heads of snow lilies can be observed, already preparing a foretaste of the next spring.

A striking start to the tour is the large scree field at the foot of the Immenstädter Horn. At the end of the 1990s, a large part of the mountain flank slid down into the valley here. After crossing the flood defences of the Steigbachtobel, the trail leads uphill into the forest towards the Mittag mid-station. The trail is also easy to walk with children, as there are no exposed areas or areas where there is a risk of falling.</p>\n<p>The small, unimproved hiking trail does not lead too steeply over many steps. There are always beautiful views over the whole of Immenstadt with the Alpsee in the west, the Illertal valley as far as Kempten in the north and the Grünten, the guardian of the Allgäu, in the east. After a relatively short time, you leave the forest again and cross the high pastures of the Alpe directly to the Hochried Alpe, which invites you to take a break. Fortified with coffee and homemade cake, or alternatively hearty bacon and cheese from our own production, you continue to the Steigbachtobel.</p>\n<p>The wooden chapel at the entrance to the ravine and the statue of the Virgin Mary, which can be found in a six-metre-high Nagelfluh boulder, invite you to take another rest. The descent starting here directly into the Steigbachtobel partly requires an increased level of surefootedness and attention, especially for small children. An alternative descent is via the gravel path directly next to it, which is also home to the toboggan run in winter. At the end of the Tobelweg, there is a memorial plaque in honour of Kaiser Wilhelm on the occasion of his 100th birthday. When you arrive back at the flood protection structure, the tour is over.</p>",

Here you will also find the black pictogram showing you the way to Wasser und Weite. Follow the cycle path next to the road past the farm shop. You come to the crossroads on the B 16, keep to the right on the cycle path, past a pond. Change sides of the road at a large farm and continue along the main road. Then take the small agricultural road to the Obere Haidhofsiedlung. After the settlement, turn left towards Untere Haidhofsiedlung. You cycle across the open field, then past a gravel pit. Shortly before the Untere Haidhofsiedlung, turn right towards Aislingen. The houses come closer and closer. You reach Markt Aislingen on the main road. Continue straight on in the direction of Glött for 3.5 km. On Kirchstraße past the church to the sports field.\n\nNow park your bike!\n\nClimb the steps to the idyllically situated St Sebastian's Chapel from 1630. The Aislinger Sebastiansberg offers you a unique panoramic view over the Danube valley. The plateau, which is up to 600 m long and 210 m wide, was already fortified in prehistoric times. For more than 100 years, archaeologists have been researching the area to find out and reconstruct what the Romans did in Aislingen in ancient times. The current state of knowledge is recorded on the information boards.\n\nNow always orientate yourself in the direction of Glött directly towards a windmill across the open field. The path curves to the right and a few metres after the signpost, the tour leads down to Glött. Follow the Weilerstraße into the centre of the village to the church and the Platz der Begegnung (meeting place), with the Fugger Castle on your right.\n\nThe rule of the Fuggers is of decisive importance for the historical development of the community of Glött. The Oberamt Glött was the seat of a princely court. In 1869, the former moated castle was converted into a care and nursing institution. Today it belongs to the Regens Wagner Foundation. More than 150 years ago, Johann Evangelist Wagner, together with the matron Theresia Haselmayr and her fellow sisters of the Dillingen Franciscan order, founded the \"Deaf and Dumb Institution\" and other facilities for people with disabilities.\n\nFrom these beginnings, today's Regens-Wagner-Werk has developed with 14 locations in Bavaria. More information www.regens-wagner.de.\n\nContinue on the main road out of Glött. Follow the cycle path next to the country road to the Feldbachmühle sawmill and on to Heudorf. In the village, turn left at the signpost towards Altenbaindt 4.8 km. Cycle along the edge of the forest to a small lake. Then cycle slightly uphill in the forest to a hikers' car park. After the forest, head towards a farm. You cross the country road and have reached Altenbaindt.\n\nThe vicarage in Altenbaindt is a protected monument.\n\nSituated on the south side of the parish church of St. Stephan, the hipped-roof building was erected under parish priest Balthasar Bechtold.\n\nAt the crossroads, you now head towards Holzheim and Dillingen. You ride briefly downhill, then across the open field to Holzheim and Weisingen. Both villages are built right next to each other. At the Herrgottskapelle chapel, turn right towards Lauingen and continue straight ahead on the little road.\n\nSoon you come to a bathing area - beware, only a small path branches off to the left to the bathing lake! A beautiful sunbathing lawn and the clear water invite you to stop for a swim.\n\nFollow a path along another lake, then turn right to the small bridge over the gravel conveyor belts. Continue to the golf course with refreshment stop (beer garden). On the cycle path to the farm estate in Riedwiedshausen. Go straight on towards Dillingen, then turn right to the Danube bridge. Now take the direction of the town centre and Lauingen. You will arrive in the middle of the old town. Now park the bikes and explore Dillingen on foot.\n\nTip: Before the bike tour, download the smartphone app \"Lauschtour Kneipp Dillingen\" or borrow an iPod from the tourist information office. Exciting stories told in a lively way make the town tour a special highlight. We recommend visiting stations 1,2,3 and then 7 and 8 in the town centre. You can pass the other stations by bike.\n\nAt the end of the Old Town turn right to the traffic lights. Cross the road at the taxi park. Go straight past the school and the hospital. Attention: Where the cycle path, which is separated from the pavement, turns right, turn left. At the end of the cul-de-sac, go down to the Kneipp pool and the rest area. Cross the small bridge into the floodplain forest towards Lauingen. Beautifully shaded, you come to a chapel and then to the bank of the Danube. Cycle directly along the river for the last few kilometres to Lauingen.",

Although visible evidence is not abundant, a cultural-historical excursion to the \"Swabian Danube Valley Cycling Region\" is nevertheless worthwhile, as the theme of \"Romans\" is implemented in many ways in the towns along the VIA DANUBIA.Worth mentioning at this point are the partial reconstruction of the Apollo-Grannus temple in Faimingen/Lauingen - the largest known temple complex north of the Alps, the archaeological show trail in Günzburg, the Roman milestone in Gundelfingen, the Roman lookout tower in Offingen, the villa burial ground in Ellerbach/Holzheim or the numerous local museums with Roman exhibits in Günzburg, Lauingen, Gundremmingen, Wertingen, Mertingen and Oberndorf am Lech. Or simply enjoy the magnificent view over the Danube valley from Sebastiansberg in Aislingen, the site of the earliest fort along the VIA DANUBIA.It was not only the Romans who left a lasting mark on our homeland. Alamannic graves in Unterthürheim/Buttenwiesen or the Jewish settlement in Binswangen all bear witness to a continuing and diverse cultural influence. Famous people or noble families were also at home in the Swabian Danube Valley. Albertus Magnus was born in Lauingen and the Fugger noble family was based in Glött as well as in Oberndorf am Lech.powered by",

            "description_long": "This team competition, consisting of the 4 disciplines of paddling (3km), mountain biking (12km), road biking (24km) and running (8km), challenges the athletes anew every year. Excitement is already guaranteed at the mass start of the paddlers. Can someone sitting on a surfboard, equipped only with a paddle, break away from the main peloton this year to give his team mate a valuable second advantage for the mountain bike course? We shall see. On the 12km long mountain bike course, up to the Höblinger Kogel, we will see who has enough strength and endurance. But beware: small reserves are still necessary to cope with the short but rapid descent and the way back to Loibichl. Back at the finish, the race begins for the racing cyclist. They have to complete a lap around the idyllic Mondsee. A good time on the racing bike is a solid basis for the runner, who hopefully will not have exhausted himself too much while cheering on his comrades. An 8km long running course with two short but extensive climbs also demands the last of your team's runners.",

Between the two very cosy huts, the path is clearly the goal.</p>\n<p>The first part takes us along the Heilbronner Weg. This is one of the oldest paths in the Alps and was established more than 100 years ago. Absolute surefootedness and a head for heights are required on this trail, as it runs directly along the ridge of the Allgäu main ridge in some places. Along the way, there are numerous panoramic views over the Allgäu and into the Lech valley with its mountains. In good weather, you can always make out the Zugspitze and the Wildspitze on the horizon. One of the highlights is the Heilbronner Thörle. This is a crevice in the rock, which is already very narrow with a large rucksack. A short time later there is a 5 m high airy ladder to climb and we reach the highest point of the Heilbronner Weg, the Steinschartenkopf. Directly afterwards, a small bridge has to be crossed on the ridge. In the further course, there are repeatedly passages secured with steel ropes, until we finally reach the end of the Heilbronner Weg after the Bockkarkopf at the Bockkarscharte.</p>\n<p>We then cross the - still remaining - rest of the Schwarzmilz Ferner. Up to the turnoff to the Großer Krottenkopf at the Krottenkopfscharte, the trail leads without any major technical demands, at first in an up and down and later sharply uphill through a varied landscape. From the Scharte, the path up to the Großer Krottenkopf becomes more demanding again, so that absolute sure-footedness and a head for heights are again required here. On the summit of the Großer Krottenkopf, which is the highest peak in the Allgäu, we have a wonderful 360-degree view.</p>\n<p>We leave the highest point of the tour and descend into Hermannskar to the ice-cold Hermannskarsee. The trail continues on mostly rocky terrain towards the Hermann-von-Barth Hut.</p>",

            "description_long": "The newly designed town centre in the area of Raiffeisenstraße in Bruck an der Glocknerstraße is the starting point for the tour to the summit of the Hundstein. <br/>To begin, cross the Salzach River on the Glockner Bridge, immediately turn right and continue along the Salzach River downstream in an easterly direction. After 1.5 km, there is an ascent on the left and you follow the signs for the Hundstein mountain bike route. The first strenuous section begins here. <br/>On a steep asphalt road, you overcome the first 340 metres in altitude in seven long serpentines. A long straight follows, which leads into a wide right-hand bend. The spectacular view of the western Salzach valley invites you to take a breather. <br/>After two more narrow bends, you pass a farm and then reach a small parking bay in front of a road barrier. Here the asphalt road ends and turns into a gravel path, on which you continue parallel to the slope, but steadily uphill, through dense coniferous forest. Shortly afterwards, you ride over several steep and blocky hairpin bends that demand a lot from the cyclist before you reach a small holiday settlement at the Erlhofplatte. <br/>You follow a narrow forest path marked \"MTB\" through the settlement and cycle north along the western flank of the Hahneckkogel. In the valley you can see Zellam See and the Zeller See.Below the Breitenkopf, a wide right-hand bend leads to over 1700 m above sea level. The ice fountain, a small spring, offers an excellent opportunity to refill your water bottles. Still following the \"MTB\" signs to the north, you soon reach the tree line. High above Zell am See, you now continue over the Moosalmhöhe, where the ridge has to be crossed. On the east side, the route goes over the Ebnerscharte past the Ochsenkopf. Here you have the destination of the tour, the 2117 m high Hundstein, in front of you. On the left hand side, a narrow, blocky trail branches off, which you follow up to the summit of the Hundstein. After a short stretch, you reach a passable gravel path on which you cover the last few metres up to the summit cross. After a well-deserved refreshment at the Statzerhaus and the breathtaking view of the surrounding peaks, it is recommended to check the brakes before starting the descent. <br/>You follow the same path back to the starting point in Bruck.",

            "description_long": "We start our tour at the water park in Starnberg, turn left and also keep left in front of the car dealership. We continue straight ahead to a large traffic light intersection. After crossing this diagonally to the right, a challenging climb awaits us (Hanfelder Straße). After a short descent, we change to the cycle path on the left side of the road, which leads us comfortably through the forest to Hanfeld. We cross the small town on the main road and follow the cycle path sign to the left shortly before leaving the town. Follow the paved forest road to Mamhofen, a farm with a small church. Follow the road from Mamhofen to the right and shortly afterwards leave it to the left in the direction of Unering. The following section of the trail through the forest is marked throughout with the signs of the Kreisradwanderweg. Passing a small model airfield, we cycle across fields and meadows to Unering. To reach the village, we turn right at the crossing road. At the first junction in Unering we turn left onto Andechser Straße to Drößling. After a short descent on the country road, we reach the crossroads in Drößling, see the church on the right (1) and follow the main road to the turnoff to Frieding. Once there, we turn right towards Starnberg - taking our bearings from the yellow traffic sign, as the cycle path signs indicate a different route. We leave the village on Hartstraße and turn right at the Y-junction in an open field (cycle path sign Erling). From a distance we can already see the monastery church of Andechs (2). For a short tour of the monastery hill, we leave our bikes down at the car park. Then we pedal leisurely through Erling, crossing the main road and cycling along a narrow, winding country road to Machtlfing. We always follow the signs of the Kreisradwanderweg. At the maypole in Machtlfing keep to the right, likewise at the following crossroads. We pass a large adventure playground and cycle along a pleasant country road past Friedauer Hof. Continuing through the forest, an impressive view of the mountain panorama of the Alps soon opens up. Now we circle Gut Kerschlach, a large equestrian farm with its own bakery, and head towards Tutzing. We carefully cross the main road and cycle along a gravel path into the forest. After a short while, the road turns first to the right and then immediately to the left. Steadily straight ahead we reach a long descent that ends at a priority road in Tutzing. Here we pedal to the left and then past several railway subways until the cycle path signs lead us to the left onto Traubinger Straße. This takes us steeply uphill through an imposing villa district out of Tutzing, where the road turns into a paved forest path. Now cycle straight ahead at the crossroads in the forest and pass a golf course. Once in Traubing, we follow the cycle path signs and cycle across wide fields on a comfortable asphalt path to Aschering. There we turn right and before the birch avenue left - both in the direction of Starnberg. We cross a small wooden bridge and pass the second bridge a few metres later. In the forest we meet the deeply cut Fallbach stream, which we follow to the Maisinger See lake (3). A small bathing area with a diving tower invites you to refresh yourself. Via Maising we reach Söcking, a district of Starnberg. We continue to pay attention to the cycle path signs and cycle downhill on Andechser Straße. When we see the stone St. Ulrich church on the left, we turn diagonally right onto a small side path. Follow this and you will reach the Söckinger Straße. Continue along this road until you reach the large crossroads, where St. Joseph's Church (4) towers over the roofs on your left. Straight ahead through the one-way street we finally reach the pedestrian subway - on the right hand side is the Museum Starnberger See (5). We continue to the left and follow the cycle path signs to the water park, the starting and finishing point of our tour. To round off the beautiful day, a detour to the archaeological site of the Villa Rustica in Leutstetten (6) is a good idea.",

Along the banks of the gently meandering river we pass Mettingen before reaching Untertürkheim. We continue parallel to the railway line and come to the Inselbad (1), which lies on an artificial island between the Uhlbach and the Neckar. We continue on the cycle path, which takes us under the B14 past the edge of the sports facilities of the Mercedes-Benz Arena (2). This is the sporting home of the successful Bundesliga team VfB Stuttgart, the region's footballing flagship. The sporting challenge for us is limited up to this point - but we can enjoy the charming mixture of city flair and beautiful nature as we go along. We change banks over a bridge and then leave the river to the left on the B10. We cycle through the beautiful parks of the Wilhelma in a south-westerly direction and enter the city traffic behind the palace park. Our cycle path leads uphill on less frequented side roads to Degerloch. We now leave the city behind us and follow the scenic Ramsbach valley. The route descends steadily to Scharnhausen, which is announced by the white facades of Scharnhausen Castle (3). From the pleasure palace, the route continues downhill through the Körschtal valley and past an open-air swimming pool (4) to Denkendorf, where we also pass the former monastery (5). Our route then turns left and, accompanied by wooded hills, heads north-east. At the former Körschburg (6) we reach the banks of the Neckar again and continue on a road to Sirnau. There we change sides of the river and follow the riverbank path back to Esslingen. At the railway station we have reached the destination of our journey - before departure, however, it is worth visiting the charming old town of Esslingen (7), which invites you to take a leisurely stroll or stop for a bite to eat in one of the small cafés or restaurants.",

In a wide curve to the right, we leave the built-up area and pass agricultural fields before the path turns left at the edge of Nidda. Cycle parallel to the railway line through the fields. An airfield (2) soon passes on the left, from where glider pilots take off for their sightseeing flights over the Hoher Vogelsberg Nature Park. We meet a country road, which we follow to the left for a while, but then immediately turn right again. Our route now takes us above the Salzbach stream in the direction of Süden. The flat route runs almost exclusively through the fields, only occasionally do we pass small woods. From the junction with the Salzbach we follow the Niddatal into historic Dauernheim. This district of Ranststadt dates back to the 8th century and, in addition to charming old buildings, has a lot of living history. The rock cellars, for example under the Protestant church (3), bear witness to the bygone days. In the village, the path curves to the right and quickly leads out again into the slightly undulating Altenbeunde. The farmland is lined with a light stand of trees and accompanies us past the Faulenberg towering on the right. We continue in open country, pass a short right-left combination and then reach Geiß-Nidda, which is already announced to us on the way by the tower of the church (4). Still in the town, our route turns right and passes a sports field, behind which we turn left. We are now back in the fields, but are visibly approaching a narrow stretch of forest. A little later we cycle under the roof of the Bäum along the spa gardens. After a short ride we meet up with the path we already know from the outward journey, which finally brings us back to the starting point of our tour along the same route.",

The shade of the trees accompanies us on the way up to the Rennsteigwarte (1), a tower with a great view at the highest point of the Eselsberg. We then descend quickly into the Hohe Heide, where our trail joins the Planieweg. Now we take a slightly winding route through the hollow and soon uphill again on the southern slope of the Kleiner Sauberg. At a crossroads, we leave the Rennsteig on an asphalt road that leads us along the western flank of the Großer Sauberg. On a continuously undulating route profile, we then pass the Pechleite and turn left onto the crossing road. Not far from the Schweinsberg, we reach the clear Friedrichshöhe (2), where the environmental centre of the Thuringian Forest Nature Park is located. We can also take the opportunity for a stop or rest here. The trail then continues slightly uphill on a road parallel to the Rennsteig. Over the Rattelsberg we come to Siegmundsburg. There we leave the forest and descend across a green meadow area to the B281. Immediately after crossing under the federal road, our path turns right and after a short ride we reach the Hintere Werraquelle (3). The Werra joins the Fulda at Hann. Münden and forms the Weser, the longest river running exclusively on German soil. Here we turn around and follow the already familiar route back until we find ourselves behind the small Sauberg again. Instead of following the Rennsteig again, however, we keep left on the asphalt road. We pass the Vordere Werraquelle (4) and ride in a wide arc around the Sommerberg. In doing so, we constantly follow the Masserberg Höhenweg (high trail), which leads us on a scenic route back to the climatic health resort, where we return to the church in the centre of the village and thus also arrive back at the starting point of our tour.",

Soon we come to the Schwefelbach, where our route bends to the left and continues with excellent views over the blue water. We pass through the slopes of the Schwefelkopf and Märterskopf, which rise imposingly to our right. A little later, there is a slight bend to the right that leads us into the fjord-like Tannengrund. We stay on the lakeside promenade, which bends sharply to the left here and leaves the valley cut. In a wide right-hand bend, we pass the wooded hills of Hohenofenkopf and Haschbachskopf until we pass the Schleusegrund reservoir (3). Immediately afterwards we ride to the nearby Gabelsgrund. Here we again cycle around one of the elongated foothills of the lake and then continue at the foot of the Vorderer Arolsberg. We are now on the slightly sloping western shore of the lake. On the way south, we leave the Schleuseberg and Mittelberg mountain ranges behind us. We overcome a short ascent before quickly descending past the dam wall into the valley of the lock. After a short while we are back on the familiar route from the outward leg, which leads us past a sports field (4) back to Schönbrunn.

Before the river we turn right and follow the Tauber until we change banks over the next bridge. Soon we pass the sports and spa facilities and the spa park and cycle under the B19. On our right is Neuhaus Castle (1), which we reach by taking a short detour. Along the Tauber again, we reach the wine village of Markelsheim, where there is an educational wine trail. During our tour we pass a typical landscape of cairns. This is characterised by broken up stone walls and hedges between dry and flower meadows. Parallel to the railway tracks, we first reach Elpersheim and then Weikershem. The highlight of the route is the Renaissance castle of Weikershem (2), which awaits us with its baroque garden, alchemy museum and magnificent rooms. The village centre with its village museum, parish church and market square is also beautiful. The idyllic path now runs via Schäftersheim and in the valley of the Nassau Brook to the village of Nassau with its early Gothic church. Afterwards we reach Lichthausen via Bernsfelden and finally Harthausen. On our way, surrounded by fields, we come across several wayside crosses, the one at Vierzehnheiligen is particularly beautiful. Before reaching the village of Löffelstelzen (3), we walk around a military installation. The church tower in the village also serves as a water tower. Finally, we pass the forest on the Löffelstelzer road back to the river Taube. Cross the river and you are immediately back in Bad Mergentheim.

On the market square you can visit the Neptune Fountain and the town hall. From the Hülderlinturm (1), a remnant of the city wall, we can let our gaze wander over the castle, the Necker river and the beautiful houses of the city. Today, the castle houses part of the university and a museum. The 56-metre-high tower of the abbey church can also be climbed. Another destination is the Seufzerwäldchen, the city's largest island. We start our tour at the station and immediately head along Derendinger Alle to the banks of the Necker, which we follow after a left turn. Passing under the B28, the path runs steadily along the bank, whose side we change over the next bridge. Now we cycle through Hirschau and an industrial area before our way leads us to Rottenburg. The medieval town is over 2000 years old and is characterised by its narrow streets and the tower of St. Martin's Cathedral (2). The Diocesan Museum and the Roman Museum are also worth a visit. From here, we can make a steep and not unimportant detour to the Wurmlinger Chapel with its Romanesque crypt. Finally, we cycle back to the Neckar to continue our tour on the Neckerhalde road. We cycle mostly in the green via Oberna, Bierlingen and Sulzau. We then take this route back to Rottenburg, this time going straight ahead at the market square, across the crossroads and continuing on the Sülchenstrasse. To the right of our path is the Sülchenkirche (3), where the bishops of Rottenburg were buried. The history of the building goes back to the 6th century, but the present building dates largely from the 16th century. The next village we reach is Wurmlingen. We cycle into the village on Almenstrasse and turn left onto Briccusstrasse, which leads into Weidestrasse. We cycle straight ahead until we turn right before the Ammer and pass a sports field. At the „Untere Mühle“ üwe cross the railway tracks, turn right immediately after and cycle the last stretch before Tübingen between the fields. Soon we reach the town and cycle along the Schleifmühleweg under the B28 to the station.  ",

From there we follow the tracks and cycle via Schmiechen to Schelklingen, which has a local history museum in the town hall. On the country road we cycle past Weiler to Blaubeuren. Here we can take a look at the „küssende Sau“, one of the most bizarre rock formations in the entire Schwäbische Alp. In addition, the Brillenhöle, where prehistoric tools were found, is nearby. In the Museum of Prehistory (2) we can see even more ancient finds. The market square is adorned by the half-timbered town hall and a fountain. It is not far from here to the monastery, whose church has a magnificent high altar. Particularly exciting is the Blautopf (3), which at 21 metres deep is one of the largest karst springs in Europe. The cave system has not yet been fully explored. Nearby is the Hammermle, a former waterworks. Finally, we cycle along the Mühlweg past the open-air swimming pool and turn right onto the Dodelweg and then always along the Blau river. This takes us through Gerhausen and Arnegg to Blaustein. The town with its pretty houses invites you to take a break. In Klingenstein on the opposite side there is a castle, but it is privately owned, so we can only look at the façade. Afterwards, our path runs close to the Bundesstrasse in the direction of Ulm. At the Blaubeurer Tor, we follow the signs to the city centre, which take us to our destination. The famous Ulmer Münster (4) with the highest church tower in the world awaits our visit. The Bread Museum is also unique. Another sight worth seeing is the town hall with its astronomical clock and historic staircase. Nearby we also find the town museum, the butcher's tower and the fishermen's quarter.",

Soon we leave the last houses of Thürnstein and Schrenkenthal behind us and follow the idyllic course of the river. The trail climbs gently through the cool forest at the foot of the Kühberg before reaching Lohberghütte through the open countryside. There, a little to the right of our route, is the Bayerwald Animal Park (1). Before and after the village, we cross the Wei&szlig Regen and start the increasingly steep climb to Sommerau. Behind the tranquil hamlet we cycle along the river bank again and a little later enter the dense forest again. We now cycle in a southerly direction until we follow a bumpy forest path to the Kleiner Arbersee (2), in which there are several floating islands - relics from the last ice age. Here we can stop for a swim to cool off, as the most challenging section of our tour still lies ahead of us. This begins after we have cycled back along the forest path and turned right at the road. First we climb sharply up to the beautiful mountain inn Mooshütte (4) and then in serpentines up to Brennes. We reach the village on a small, treeless plateau and are now above 1000 m ü. NN. From the village we take the Brennes road, which leads us to the valley station of the Arber mountain railway with a view of the Great Arber (3). Here we get out of the saddle and take the gondola to the summit, from where we enjoy the fantastic panoramic view of the surrounding mountains and valleys. Later we return to our bikes and start our way back. After the strenuous outward journey, we can now look forward to a smooth downhill ride and return relaxed to the station in Lam, where we started our tour.",

The high valley is criss-crossed by small rivers and surrounded on both sides by wooded hills. Our route is winding and now climbs more steeply to the edge of the forest and then runs in a wide curve to Arnbruck. On the way through the village we leave the chapel (3) on the left and then enter a wooded passage. We follow the Waldwiesenbach stream a little to the left and reach the Poschingerhütte (4). The forest inn offers an excellent place to stop, with a rustic ambience and good home cooking. We then return along the same road, but continue straight ahead at the crossroads. The Waldwiesenbach stream accompanies us through the Balsried forest before we finally reach Drachselried, which is announced to us from afar by its church (5). Afterwards, two sharp climbs take us up to Oberried and the Laubberg. A gentle descent takes us to the tranquil village of Mais and past a small chapel (6), before we start the last climb up the Kühberg. Finally, we cycle into Bodenmais, where the beautiful town centre with the church (7) awaits us before we reach our destination at the station and thus end our tour.   ",

Immediately afterwards, our route branches off to the right. We change to the other side of the railway line and then follow a car-free path parallel to the tracks, which leads us along the fields to Pretzfeld. The tranquil market is dominated by its medieval castle (2), which offers beautiful gardens, old trees and an excellent view over the Wiesent valley. After the detour through the village, the route soon continues parallel to the railway line again. On an easy ride we enjoy the idyll of the farmland as we approach Kirchehrenbach. At a small chapel (3) we change to the main road, which leads us into the built-up area. At the church, our path branches off to the left onto the road to Ehrenbruck, which takes us out of the village again. At a fork we keep left and cycle up the steep serpentines to the Walberla. At the top we are rewarded for our efforts with the historic Walpurgis Chapel (4) and a fantastic view. We then descend along the same path until we reach the fork again and continue to the left. We now descend through extensive orchards into the picturesque church village of Schlaifhausen, where we keep to the right at the church and ride back through the village into the meadows. At the edge of a small village we follow the Graubachgraben and then cycle left down to Wiesenthau, which is dominated by the imposing Renaissance castle of Wiesenthau (5). The landmark of the three-floor complex are the four bulbous corner towers with their pointed red spires. The magnificent building is followed by a small pond, behind which the path leads out into the countryside again. After a stretch along the railway line, we cross the tracks and cycle to Reuth. Before the church (6), we cycle a short distance on the main road to the left until the kindergarten path branches off to the right. We continue in a westerly direction between the outskirts of Oberholz and the built-up area and soon reach Forchheim. Near the town centre, a bridge takes us over the railway line, behind which we turn left to reach the railway station, where we have reached the destination of our tour.",

            "description_long": "Our cycle tour begins at Pottenstein's market square, from where we immediately set off in an easterly direction along the main road and then follow the Lohrg ßchens. On our right, a wooded hill rises up and accompanies us on the way out of the spa town. The Püttlach flows towards us on the left. We soon cycle and hike through the shady Püttlachtal valley, where there are also numerous Stone Age caves, which are particularly popular with hikers. We cycle gently uphill along the small river, which runs through the forest in numerous small bends. We change banks via a ford (1) and then continue eastwards. In some places the towering dolomite walls, which beautifully frame the original landscape, seem almost gorge-like. After a good stretch we come to the Heiligensteg (2), where we change sides of the river again and follow the changing course in a northerly direction. At the edge of the Hollenberg forest, the ascent is now somewhat steeper, but we can still make our way forward on the well-maintained path without any problems. At a fork in the forest path, we finally leave the Püttlach and the dense forest to the right on a lush green meadow. The challenging climb up to Hollenberg is rewarded with a wonderful view. At the top we have the opportunity to get out of the saddle and tackle the short climb to the summit and the ruin (3) on foot. Afterwards we take the bike again and ride downhill on the same route, but then follow the road to the left, which leads us down into the Herbstgrund. We keep going downhill in the direction of Willenreuth, which we reach behind a small hilltop. From here we leave the forest behind us and head west across farmland. Parallel to the edge of the forest, the route then begins to climb slightly until we reach the old Elbersberg chapel (4). The descending passage to the second chapel worth seeing is quite leisurely – the Hofmann Chapel (5) then awaits us behind a small knoll on the left side of the path. Now we go uphill for a little while before we can start the final descent to the destination of our tour. In steep serpentines we descend with a view of the imposing Pottenstein Castle (6) back to the village. Finally, we cycle along Pegnitzerstra;e and Hauptstra;e past the Kunigundenkirche (7) back to the market square where we originally started our cycle tour.",

After walking around the Residenzplatz with a view of the Mariensäule and the Notre Dame monastery, we keep to the right and take the Seminarweg down to the Altmühl. After just a few metres, the beautiful gardens of the Kaputzin monastery (1) appear on our left. From the university, our route runs directly along the banks of the river, in which a small island emerges. Accompanied by picturesque green spaces, we then continue out of town, catching a glimpse of the charming Coblenzl-Schlösschen on our right. We then change banks and leave the built-up area on the disused railway line of the Altmühlbahn. At the foot of the Stadtberg we cycle through Pietenfeld and on to Pfünz. Here we cross the Altmühl again on a bridge and cycle along the edge of the Dominikanerholz into the tranquil village of Inching, which is home to a charming little chapel (2). We then come to a plain characterised by numerous farmlands, in which the church village of Walting is located. There we once again change the Almtmühl bank and ride through the idyllic river meadows past the Walting district of Rieshofen. Here there is an island in the water with the ruins (3) of a high medieval moated castle. From Pfalzpaint we ride on the left side of the river again and enjoy the picturesque wet meadows at the double river bend, while the tree population visibly increases in the direction of Gungolding. To our right, a dolomite massif rises above the treetops, on which the ruins of Arnsberg Castle (4) are enthroned. Another imposing estate awaits us shortly afterwards in Kipfenberg, where we enjoy the best view of the castle of the same name as we pass, which also houses the Roman and Bavarian Museum (5) - a worthwhile detour for all those interested in history. We now follow the slightly sloping riverside path that leads northwards through the narrowing river valley via Grösdorf and Ilbling to Kinding. There we cross the railway tracks and then turn right, where we have reached the station, the destination of our trip.",

The Main Cycle Path was the first route to be awarded a \"five-star quality cycle route\" by the General German Bicycle Club.</p>\n<p>We are on the section from Bad Staffelstein to Bamberg and follow the excellent signposting from the car park at the Obermain Therme. First we reach Niederau and Ebensfeld via Unterzettlitz and past meadows, which we pass by the railway station. Via Unterleiterbach and Zapfendorf we come to Ebing, make a right turn to Rattelsdorf, before we cycle via Breitengüßbach further to Kemmern and from there to Hallstadt. Here we leave the Main cycle path and continue cycling south. First via Seebachstraße, after crossing Bamberger Straße and through the motorway subway we already enter the Bamberg city area. Via Hallstadter Straße, Siechenstraße and Untere Königsstraße we reach the tourist heart of the world heritage city. At the newly designed Kettenbrücke bridge, we turn right and after a few metres we are in the pedestrian zone. Here we can park our bike at Maxplatz and stroll through the city centre on foot. It takes about ten minutes to walk to the Old Town Hall, which is enthroned with magnificent half-timbering in the middle of the two arms of the Regnitz. Little Venice is also not far away - and uphill we reach Bamberg Cathedral, the Old Court and the Rose Garden.\n</p><p>For the return journey, we can take the train with connections every half hour - or we can venture home on the same route by bike!</p>",

After the mini-golf course, leave the dam and take the federal road (pedestrian traffic lights) to reach the Altmühl ladder. Along the Überleiter, which flows partly underground in a tunnel üt crosses the main European watershed and reaches the small Brombachsee at its end. Via the Dammweg you cycle past the Absberg bathing peninsula and the SAN-shine-Camp, which not only offers a programme for children but is also interesting for adults with sports such as archery. Further along the dam between the Igelsbachsee and the Grosse Brombachsee, you reach Enderndorf, where a high ropes course invites you to climb in the forest a little away from the lake, and a barefoot path in the vicinity over a distance of 1900m challenges your sense of touch. Past Allmannsdorf, over the large dam wall to the opposite side of the lake to Pleinfeld with the opportunity to visit the local summer toboggan run and the adjacent wildlife park. On the way back, you pass the lakeside centres of Ramsberg and Langlau, where you can enjoy a game of miniature golf at the end of the day. The latter, however, can also be made up for at the lake centre in Schlungenhof after arriving back at the Altmühl;berleiter. If you still feel like it, you can complete the loop and return to Muhr am See via the forest or end the day with a beautiful sunset at the Seegasthof.\r\n<p>If the way back should be too strenuous after all the side activities or the game of mini-golf has dragged on, there is the option of taking the train home from Pleinfeld, Ramsberg or Langlau.</p>",

            "description_long": "We start our ride at the train station in Bad Überkingen, which we leave on Bahnhofstra;e, along a small park über the Fils and turn left out of town. We cross the B466 and head west along the lower edge of the Eichhalde. The rising Fils valley narrows here into a narrow aisle between the hills of the Schotten and the Kempthalde. This is already an indication of the impressive scenery that awaits us through the valley. After a short time we reach the small village of Hausen, where we pass a venerable church (1) and immediately leave the built-up area behind us. Our cycle path runs parallel to the B466, which is a short distance to our left. The ascent continues steadily, while we reach the outskirts of Reichenbach on the southern flank of the Weigoldberg through beautiful green areas. Our route now describes a left turn that leads us to Deggingen, surrounded by wooded hills. At the foot of the elevations we enjoy the view over the meadows (2), which we will soon exchange for steep rock faces. Immediately afterwards we continue to Ditzenbach, overlooked by the imposing ruins of Hiltenburg Castle (3), which is situated slightly to the south-west on a hill. We continue our journey below the old fortress and soon reach Mühlhausen. Here, too, we stay on the banks of the Fils, which flows down through the valley from the village of Wiesensteig. There the Fils valley narrows visibly between the steep hills of the Wolfsklinge and the Katzenfelsen and heads west. Accompanied by a light stand of trees, rocky walls and the course of the river provide a dreamlike backdrop in which the open-air swimming pool (4) on our left is embedded. Here we can take the opportunity to take a break and take a refreshing plunge into the cool water before continuing our journey. The route now curves towards the south and the climb picks up again in the last few metres. The last few metres of ascent are full of bends and we reach the source of the Fils, which is not far from a hut (5) that invites you to stop for a bite to eat during the summer months. We have now reached the turning point of our tour. We return along the familiar path, which now leads us pleasantly back to Überkingen, where we originally began our journey.",

            "description_long": "We start our journey at Bad Urach railway station, from where we follow the B28 in a north-easterly direction. We pass through the beautiful Webervorstadt, with its interesting building facades and old buildings, the most imposing of which is undoubtedly the Dicke Turm (1). The bulbous colossus rises on a green hill immediately to our left. After a few pedal strokes, we turn left onto Neuffener Straße, which leads north past the Festhalle (2). We keep to the right on the uphill stretch and ride at the foot of the Kälberburen into the Elsachtal. We leave the buildings behind us and pass some nice restaurants before the Pfähler valley splits off from the Marienthal, which we follow strongly uphill to the left. We soon come to the well-known Kaltentalhäuschen (3) with the Kaltenthalweiher (Kaltenthal pond) directly behind it, where the brave may dare to jump into the cool mountain water. Back in the saddle, we continue uphill through the narrow Kaltental valley, where we keep to the right halfway and return to the Kaltenthal pond. The next branch leads us into the Lenninger valley, at the end of which the small Kohlteichweiher (4) awaits, which we circle clockwise and then start the steep climb to the Fuchsberg. We don't go all the way up to the summit, but keep left beforehand on the path to the panoramic plain of Grabenstetten. After the relaxed descent, however, we only touch the town on the edge and immediately turn off onto the Urach road. We pass the \"Spitzige Felsle\" and continue our leisurely descent over the Lauereck into the Elsachtal valley. Here you will find the well-known Falkenstein Cave (5), which is well worth a detour for those interested in geology. Our route now leads southwest through the Elsachtal, which is lined with dense trees. We follow the country road, which we only leave to the left at the mouth of the Büchelbrunnenbach stream and ride steeply uphill along the rushing water to a refuge (6). Here we can take a break before we start the descent back to the country road, which then leads us left into the Pfähler valley. This brings us back to the route we knew from the outward journey, which we now ride back in the opposite direction. Soon the valley opens up and we reach Bad Urach, where we cover the last few metres to the train station, the starting point of our ride. At the end, we can take a stroll through the charming old town, where we can stop off at one of the numerous cafés and restaurants.",

            "description_long": "The starting point of the mountain bike tour „Sattelbauer-Runde“ is at the tourist information office in Altenmarkt im Pongau. From here, head in a southerly direction to the edge of the forest, where there are some signposts and signs. Continue to the left, follow the path for a short distance through the forest, meander through the village and leave Altenmarkt, the oldest settlement in Salzburg's Enns Valley, on the Zauchensee road. <br/>Directly behind the campsite, turn half left, take the underpass and continue parallel to the road on a gravel path through the forest and across meadows along the rushing Zauchbach stream. <br/>Now the cycle path passes the Altenmarkt-Zauchensee High Ropes Park, and you pass partly under the stations, which are located at lofty heights.<br/>It continues slightly uphill to the road, where you follow the signs for a short while before turning left over a bridge. Then continue upstream on the dirt road until you reach the road again. <br/>Cross the road and continue steeply uphill on a wide gravel path to the Steinrosenbichelhütte. Past the barrier, continue steeply uphill through the forest, soon reaching the highest point of the tour at 1300 m. <br/>After a short, enjoyable descent, you reach the Sattel­bauer mountain inn with a petting zoo for the little guests. <br/>Freshly invigorated, the second part of the circular tour begins with a long descent on an asphalt road over several hairpin bends. <br/>You leave the road twice, each time at a bend, and follow the signs straight ahead over gravel into the forest until you meet the road again. At the end of the wonderful descent, you reach a hairpin bend and continue parallel to the motorway on the saddle track to the bridge. Cross the bridge and immediately turn right again. Follow the signs to the centre of Flachau and continue on the cycle path along the main road. After 1 km turn right over the bridge and then left onto the asphalt Enns cycle path to Feuersang. Continue downstream along the Enns until you reach the motorway underpass, then begin the final ascent, which leads in serpentines on an asphalt road up to Reitdorf. At the fork in the road after the end of the village, turn left. Now the rapid descent begins, during which you should enjoy the spectacular view of Altenmarkt and the surrounding area from time to time. At the small bridge in the village you meet up again with the route you already know from the outward journey, turn left and continue the last few metres on the same path back to the starting point.",

            "description_long": "The starting point for this tour on the Maiskogel is the large car park Schaufelberg at the entrance to Kaprun. Take the Sigmund-Thun-Straße south through the village. <br/>Just before the bus stop in the centre, turn half-right into Schulstraße and 80 m further on, half-right again into Schaufelbergstraße. From here, follow the signs for Mountain Bike Route 11D to the first climb of the tour over five long hairpin bends to the Unteraigen snack station. <br/>After a few hundred metres, turn half-right again and follow Route 11D uphill towards the Maiskogel. Two hairpin bends further on, the asphalt road ends and you head steeply uphill on a forest path over the ski slopes, past the Schaufelberg panoramic cable car and in two more narrow hairpin bends to the edge of the forest. Now you reach a short, very steep passage that requires some muscle power. At the next junction, you continue straight ahead towards the forest and can take a short breather on only a slight incline before struggling up two wide hairpin bends to reach the Maiskogel mountain station and Heli's hut on the Maiskogel-Alm at 1545 m above sea level. <br/>Intrepid hikers climb the last 130 metres, some of them very steep, via trail 11G to the Glocknerblick. You are rewarded for your efforts on the terrace of the inn. From here you have a spectacular panoramic view of the Central Alps and Austria s highest mountain, the Grossglockner, at 3798 metres. <br/>You return to the Maiskogel-Alm, from where you follow the G11 signs towards Jetzbachsteig-Schneckenberg downhill. Already after the first bend, you will see a white sign with three black arrows (\"At your own risk - Trial Schiebestück\"), which marks the beginning of the very challenging single trail section. The first section of the trail is characterised by narrow hairpin bends, many roots and partly very steep and blocky passages. The rest of the trail is easier, the winding path runs with a slight gradient over meadows and forest paths until you reach the first houses and roll along an asphalt road to the Kapruner Ache. <br/>From here you follow the signs \"Kesselfall-Radweg\" downstream towards the Sigmund-Thun-Klamm gorge, where the Kapruner Ache has cut up to 32 m deep into the rock. In many curves and bends, the narrow path winds through dense forest and ends at a power station at the beginning of Kaprun. Finally, take the Schulstraße back to the starting point at the Schaufelberg large car park.<i><br/></i>",

            "description_long": "Since 2002, Leogang has been home to Europe's largest facility for mountain biking. Mountain bike fans can let off steam here on numerous slopes with rapid and sometimes very challenging descents over hill and dale. <br/>The starting point for the soft trail loop is the Asitzbahn car park at the bike park in Leogang. This tour is also easy for beginners. The gondola lift takes you comfortably to the mountain station at 1760 m above sea level (a lift ticket is required!).<br/>Before setting off on the trail, it is a good idea to make a short detour to the summit of the Kleiner Asitzkopf at 1872 m above sea level. <br/>To do this, you ride up the steep forest path, reach the summit after a few minutes and can enjoy the magnificent mountain panorama. Return along the same path and now follow the signposting  \"MTB-Panoramatour\" to the left onto a narrow single trail that leads into a piece of forest. After a few metres, there is a short slog over narrow serpentines up to the Schönleitenhütte. From here, the route descends rapidly on gravel paths towards Jausern and Saalbach. After two hairpin bends, the route goes uphill again towards the Panoramaalm, and after further ups and downs you reach the Thurneralm. <br/>From there you follow the wonderful forest and meadow trail to the Panoramaalm and further through the forest to get downhill to the Bixerbaueralm on the Spielberg plateau. For the following short section, there is a choice of two variants (Big 5 black and Big 5 red), which meet again below the Spielberghaus. There you leave the Big 5 route and continue downhill in the direction of Eiserne Hand, passing the car park of the Burgeralm at 1279 m above sea level. <br/>The dense coniferous forest offers maximum biking pleasure! The route continues straight ahead, then in a few narrow bends and over several bridges along the stream. The long descent ends behind the Eiserne Hand inn. After the inn, continue half-right up an asphalt road to the hamlet of Hafenberg and on to Feistenau. This section of the route is particularly scenic and offers a breathtaking mountain panorama. A short climb on the B164 takes you to Hochfilzen, where you cross under the railway tracks on the left and follow the signs to Leogang. Now the trail winds for a few kilometres through the Grießener Moor, a bird paradise, and through several small villages. <br/>A last beautiful descent leads to the valley station of the Asitzbahn, where this wonderful tour began.",

The course of the river has been strongly influenced by economic use, e.g. power generation, but today attempts are being made to compensate for this by means of renaturation measures. At Maxlmühle, the M-waterway meets the Mangfall. This cycle path leads from the Deutsches Museum to Gmund am Tegernsee. On the way, important stations of Munich's water supply are visited. At Fentbach we can visit a late Celtic oppidum.",

The route is flat throughout and impresses above all with its rural charm and sections that are for the most part hardly used by traffic.",
            "description_long": "Our cycle tour starts at the railway station in Gunzenhausen, which we leave on Bahnhofstraße and reach the Altmühltal cycle path via a car-free path. This leads us immediately to the right over the rails and along the river to the Altmühlsee (1). Here we first keep left and follow the course of the west bank. With the lake on one side and the Altmühl River in Walde on the other, we are virtually surrounded by water on this leisurely ride. We pass idyllic wet meadows and several small villages until we meet the Altmühlzuleiter, the main artery of the lake. Shortly after Streudorf, a bridge leads us to the other side, where we continue to follow the lakeside path. On our right we see some small land areas in the water, which together form the bird island (2). This protected area is home to a rich population of birds. Soon we find ourselves on the eastern shore of the lake, where we are also accompanied by the Altmühl. Halfway back to Gunzenhausen, we pass a small open-air swimming pool (3), which is worth a short stop for a swim, especially in the summertime. We continue through the green spaces of the Ferswiesen and Kitzwasen before we meet the familiar route again on the outskirts of Gunzenhausen. We keep to the eastern edge of the town and continue along the car-free promenade. Still at the level of the built-up area, we change banks and follow the Altmühl into the hamlet of Aha. Our route runs a little to the left before it leaves the river and leads through the meadowland to Windsfeld. From here we follow the railway line and continue cycling not far from the idyllic river towards the southeast. We finally pass Bubenheim, where the Ziegelmühle (4) is located on the right side of the path. Before a river bend, we cross the Altmühl and continue to Graben, where our path turns sharply to the south and leads into the urban area of Treuchtlingen at the foot of the Nagelberg. Across the beautiful river meadows we enter the built-up area, where we turn right before the Altmühltherme (5) and follow a bridge to the other side of the river. Now we ride with a view of the Obere Veste (6) to the railway station, where we have reached the destination of our tour.",

On the way to Klingenberg we are again on the path along the river bank, which takes us past a church (3) along the Neckar island. We also skirt the glider airfield close to the water. We now reach the Heilbronn district of Bockingen, where we finally change banks on the B39. We first cross the harbour canal and then the Neckar itself, which runs in two parts here. We then keep to the left and take a look at the imposing Bollwerk tower (4) before continuing south along the river. Almost on the level where the canal splits off from the natural course of the river, we reach the Wertwiesenpark (5). Here we can take a break and enjoy the beautiful green spaces during a short rest. We then continue along the river past Sontheim to Horkheim, where we pass Horkheim Castle (also known as „Wasserschl;ssle“) (6). At the edge of the town, we take the bridge ücke over the shipping canal and follow the cycle path onto an island in the Neckar, at the end of which we change banks again and follow the idyllic stream on its left side. A long loop then leads us back into the town of Lauffen. At the height of the Rathausburg (7) we cross the Neckar for the last time before returning to the station to complete our tour.",

We take a look at Hohent-Bingen Castle (1), which towers imposingly over the cityscape, and leave the city in a westerly direction. Slightly uphill we continue über the rails and along the Neue Ammer along the northern flank of the wooded Spitzberg to Ammern. Here we pass the old Ammerhof church (2), an art-historical gem from the 18th century. We follow the path northwards and shortly after crossing the Mühlbach we reach the confluence of the Neue Ammer and Ammer. On a flattened stretch, the route now continues along the river through the fields and into Pfauml;ffingen. Soon we are back in the countryside and approaching Poltringen at a brisk pace. Our route leads through old rows of houses and past the former castle (3) before we leave the town. Now the route goes uphill in undulating climbs and in a wide arc über the scenic Galgenegert. In addition to our cycle route, there are also numerous hiking trails that open up the beautiful countryside. Our next stop is Reusten, which we only touch on the northern edge and immediately turn right to continue on the Römerstraße. This leads across beautiful meadows and fields to Altingen, where we turn left onto the Schönbruchstra;e and then past a hut (4) onto the cycle path along the Ammer. The river leads us under the motorway out of the built-up area and along the lower edge of Gültstein. We now cycle slightly uphill through the natural Ammertal valley, which is characterised by beautiful wet meadows and the quietly flowing river. We now follow the historical trail past the three preserved Ammer mills - once there were as many as seven mills on the upper reaches of the river. We soon leave the riverside path and drive on roads into the southern outskirts of Herrenberg. Before the Leiblesgrube, a short peak in the route profile awaits us, before the route then enters Herrenberg in a moderate climb. We follow the cycle path along the Ammer river, which we finally leave on Raistinger Strasse and ride along Walther-Knoll-Strasse to the station.

Enjoy the view of the ruins of Hohenstaufen Castle (4) - the former ancestral castle of the Staufer dynasty, whose stones were partly destroyed and reused to build the castle in Gießen. There is a short uphill stretch, then the route begins to run more and more level. Only small undulations make for a varied ride, which takes us a little to the north past the ruins of Rechberg Castle (5). On a winding route we reach Stra&szligdorf, where our cycle path describes a long left-hand bend and finally leads us into the town area of Schwanisch Gmünd. Here we follow the road along the banks of the Waldstetter Bach stream to the confluence with the Rems, from where it is only a few pedals to the railway station on our left.

Here we leave the Murr for a short detour to the former castle (3), which lies in the middle of a beautiful green area with its own pond. Soon we continue cycling parallel to the tracks along the Murr cycle path. The gently meandering river leads us up a minimal incline to Sulzbach, which we pass on its south side. The Murrtal now describes a slight curve to the left, which brings us to Schlei;weiler, where we leave the course of the river and turn right. Now the steep ascent into the Murrhardt forest awaits us. Shaded by Bäumen, we ride through the forest, which is criss-crossed by countless small Bächen, and at its almost highest point we reach a hikers' hostel (4), which offers the opportunity for a short break. Many hikers meet here to explore the surrounding hills. The trail then descends, first gently and then increasingly steeply, into the Oppenweiler district of Aichelbach.

The day tour is mostly easy in terms of riding technique, but should not be underestimated in terms of physical condition due to its length. We return to the starting point by train via Bad Tölz. Alternatively, we can cycle from Kochel to Lenggries the day before (e.g. via the tour \"<a href=\"https://www.outdooractive.com/r/6319600/\">By mountain bike from Kochel to Lenggries</a>\") and spend the night there.",

A much flatter and enjoyable descent further on, a wildly romantic picture-book landscape awaits us at the Weitsee. The exciting trail from the Gräbenalm down to the Pankratiusquelle spring is a lot of fun.

The reason for this is that our second option for the ascent runs along a sunny and thus hot south-facing slope. No matter what we decide, on summer days it is always worth making a small \"pit stop\" at the Krinnenalpe. We continue along the beautiful Alpenrosenweg via the Nesselwängler Ödenalpe to our destination, the Gräner Ödenalpe. Once we have enjoyed the breathtaking mountain panorama, we have to make another decision.

At the Straubinger Haus, we have well and truly earned a cosy stop for a break. From the panorama terrace below the Fellhorn peak, we enjoy a magnificent panorama.

The view looking north stretches out as far as the eye can see across the flatness of Bavaria whereas to the south, you are presented with a wall of seemingly unending mountains and jaw-dropping awesomeness. You can even make out Schloß Neuschwanstein if you look in the direction of Füssen. </p>\n<p>The other notable experience of this route is the flow of traffic. The Aggenstein gets very crowded as the day wears on (I guess the Bad Kissinger Hütte is a big draw), which is why I recommend you climb it first. By contrast, Roßberg comes across as a pretty lonely and unloved peak and one that we had entirely to ourselves.  </p>",

            "description_long": "This itinerary is fantastic for those who love powerful landscapes and on the way also want to enjoy a light meal and a local atmosphere in an Alpine cabin (the name of the cabin in German: Siedelalpe). In a relatively short walking distance you can reach a powerful panoramic view of the area from a great height. The walk along the route is relatively easy, but still includes a moderate ascent. Since it is a circular route, you can choose which direction to walk on the route (straight or right at the crossroads). The road that continues straight at the crossroads leads to a slightly steeper but shorter ascent, while the road that continues to the right offers a more moderate but longer ascent (this road can also be walked with prams from experience, but it must be taken into account that it is not paved and that it includes an ascent on the way up and a descent on the way back) . You can decide whether to walk the route in a circular way or go and return the same way. You can experience the peak of the view a few meters after the cabin, either on the path that continues beside it or on the path that goes up behind it. A great experience for those who want to experience a powerful landscape with not much effort.",

We start our tour in Bietigheim-Bissingen. The historic old town is famous for its beautiful town hall and the Hornmoldhaus right next to it. Here we can also see the Metter flowing into the Enz. However, our route takes us through Bietigheim's upper forest via the small town of Löchgau to Besigheim. In all the towns we can see the historic architecture in the half-timbered houses, a well-known feature of very old towns in the region. Particularly exciting is the old town wall of Besigheim, which we will see on our tour. Likewise, the path leads us several times through the vineyards, over some beautiful vantage points and through lovely, bright forest paths back to Bietigheim-Bissingen.",

Once you've done that, it's worth taking another look back and then you're on idyllic side roads without any notable climbs to Stettfurt. The proud Sunnebärg Castle is visible from afar on the southern slope. The access road leads up over the Freudenberg. Here, too, the ascent is rewarded with a magnificent view of the Fürstenland and the Alps, but the castle and its surroundings are also a feast for the eyes. <br/><br/>The way back via Thundorf and Lustdorf to Bussnang is a heart route through Thurgau. Gentle ascents offer ever new vistas of the Thurtal valley and the Alpine chain. The tranquillity is only briefly interrupted by farm work or perhaps by the howling of the engines of the Fimmelsberg cart track. After the imposing railway viaduct in Bussnang, the view opens up to the Stadler-Rail company and Weinfelden.

Fields and streams alternate with rocky and asphalted sections, and there are Kneipp stations at the beginning and end of the trail so you can wash your feet. You can also bathe your arms in the «arm bath fountain» based on the Dr. Kneipp model, which lies halfway along the trail at the «Toobeschopf Museum». In Gontenbad you'll also find the famous natural mud bath where you can relax not only your feet, but your entire body.<br/><br/><strong>Note(s)</strong><br/>The barefoot trail covers mainly open terrain. While there are a number of restaurants nearby, you should wear some sort of head covering on hot days.<br/><br/>We ask that barefoot hikers stay on the trail. For safety reasons, you may not walk on the golf course. Farmers would appreciate it if guests do not walk in long grass.<br/><br/>The trail can be followed in both directions.<br/><br/><strong>See also</strong><br/>For Supported Areas<br/>GEO-Tracks GmbH<br/>Zugerstrasse 1<br/>CH-6330 Cham<br/>Web: www.gps-tracks.com<br/>E-Mail: touren@gps-tracks.com<br/><br/>",

The route starts at the car park of the Romanshorn lakeside resort. On a very well asphalted and car-free cycle and walking path, you skate along the lake to Uttwil. After just a few minutes, you will reach the idyllically situated Holzenstein lakeside pool. In good weather, the small kiosk is open.<br/><br/>In Uttwil, several restaurants await you, located directly on the lake. Past the railway station, the lake trail continues to Kesswil. From the lower part of the village, you will now reach the village centre, which is somewhat elevated. For about 1km you will be on roads with sometimes heavy traffic. A beautiful view rewards the somewhat strenuous climb. On a hill above the lake you return to Uttwil. After a rapid descent, you return to the main road.

This first-class panorama can be particularly enjoyed from the top floor of the double-decker postbus. The journey takes 34 minutes.<br/>The St.Gallen-Rehetobel-Heiden route is served by conventional 41-seater postbuses. The approximately 40-minute journey takes you on a winding route through the hilly landscape of the Appenzeller Vorderland. Sit back, look out of the Postbus and take in the impressive images of Appenzell-ausserrhodian villages and the Alpstein mountain range - unique and original !<br/><br/>The Biedermeier village of Heiden captivates with its fabulous location as a terrace above Lake Constance. The joke trail starts at the village square in Heiden with the \"listig-träfen\" Appenzeller jokes that accompany you on the way via Wolfhalden to Walzenhausen. Children's jokes placed at eye level motivate the little ones to hike along. The path is unsuitable for prams.<br/><br/>The post bus regularly connects the villages along the way and offers the ideal return or lift if you don't want to walk the whole way. <br/><br/>From Walzenhausen you also have the option of travelling by train to Rheineck and back to St.Gallen via Rorschach, or you can change in Rheineck to the boat to Rorschach and complete your journey with another comfortable ride on the Postbus to St.Gallen. The Rorschach St.Gallen route is also partly served by double-decker Postbuses.<br/><br/><strong>Note(s)</strong><br/>- The starting point for the opposite direction of the Witzweg is Walzenhausen station. <br/>- With the OSTWIND day ticket you can enjoy a cheap day trip.<br/>- A tour of the village of Heiden with ascent to the church tower (open from May to September from <br/>13.00-15.30) is worthwhile.<br/><br/>",

On this tour you will get to know the country and its people better - sönd willkomm!<br/><br/>The starting point for this tour is Walzenhausen, the \"balcony above Lake Constance\". Enjoy the unique view over Lake Constance as far as Germany. Walzenhausen can be reached from Rheineck with the idyllic mountain railway of the Appenzeller Bahnen. From Walzenhausen the tour leads via Oberegg to St. Anton. Here the panorama extends over the entire Appenzell region and into the Rhine valley. The tour continues on the \"Suruggen\" ridge in the direction of Trogen. From Suruggen you can enjoy the view of the typical Appenzell hilly landscape. In Trogen it is worth visiting the Landsgemeindeplatz with the baroque Grubenmann Church and the Pestalozzi Children's Village Visitor Centre. After a rapid descent to Goldach, the ascent to Wald follows. In Wald, the panorama is once again magnificent, with the entire Alpstein stretching out before you. The tour then leads over the Kaien to Heiden. Discover the Biedermeier village, for example with a visit to the Henry Dunant Museum, before returning to Walzenhausen.<br/><br/><strong>Note(s)</strong><br/>For those who find cycling too strenuous or who fancy something new, many innkeepers are happy to provide electric bikes - a very special experience!

Experience a varied hike through the typical Appenzell hilly landscape and through a diverse plant world. From the Kaien, the trail continues upwards to the Kaienspitz, the highest point of this Nordic walking tour. Enjoy the unique view of Appenzell and Lake Constance. Until you get back to Heiden, you always walk a little downhill on the hill and then finally get back to the starting point at Hotel Heiden on the Seeallee.<br/><br/><strong>Note(s)</strong><br/>The Nordic Fitness Park Appenzellerland consists of seven Nordic Fitness Centres (Heiden, Walzenhausen, Speicher, Gais, Gonten, Urnäsch and Schwägalp). The individual centres are linked to each other by Nordic Walking connecting routes. The result is a comprehensive network of around 350 kilometres of signposted Nordic Walking routes - a true paradise for every Nordic walker. <br/><br/>A Nordic Fitness Centre is a location that specialises in the needs of Nordic walkers. Each centre has three signposted Nordic Walking circuits of varying difficulty. There is at least one Nordic Fitness Hotel in the village, which has geared its services entirely to your needs. There is also a sports shop in the village (or nearby) that stocks Nordic Walking-specific articles and offers professional advice. Trained instructors are able to offer courses or accompany and look after you on request.<br/><br/>The starting point is the start and finish of the three local circuits and is marked by an information board which gives you useful information about the centre and the circuits.

            "description_long": "Historic family walk along the Mühlebach stream, which once powered up to 6 mills! Before the construction of the railway in 1855, the village was almost exclusively inhabited by farmers and was therefore dependent on the work of the millers.<br/><br/>Sights:<br/><br/>1. Old vicarage<br/>In 1672, a doctor Vonderwahl from Mannheim built a house \"in the Hengarten\" (today's market square), which was acquired by the parish for the vicar in 1710. In 1736, the chamber above the parlour was converted into a study. The house served as a vicarage until 1975. <br/><br/>2nd town house<br/>Built in 1931 / 32 by architecture professor ETH Friedrich Hess, Zurich. Next to it \"Muni\" by Otto Schilt (1935). <br/><br/>3. Evang. Kirche<br/>The building from 1892 (architect Aug. Hardegger, St. Gallen) replaced the old church (today Kirchgemeindehaus) on Romanshorner Strasse, which had become too small, and has since been rebuilt twice. <br/><br/>4. Hellmüli:<br/>The Hell or Heldmühle is first documented in 1446. The name comes from \"hell\" and means \"lower situated\". Because the name sounded too sinister, it later became \"Heldmühle\".<br/>In 1681, the tenant set up a flat above the mill without permission. However, with the subsequent permission, tenant Paur paid the court costs! In 1763, two water wheels were in operation and a second \"Mahlhaufen\" (mill mill) was put into operation. In 1890 the mill was shut down. The Sallmann company acquired the mill and set up a hydroelectric power station to generate electricity.<br/>Today, a small turbine is driven by the reconstructed water wheel.<br/><br/>5. Breitenaach:<br/>First mentioned in 1403 as Braiten Aich, later Braitenbach. The owner was the monastery of St.Gallen, which gave the mill in fief.<br/>In its heyday, three water wheels supplied the energy for the grain mill, a haberdörre and a meat chopper. The latter worked for the butchers in the area. Around 1900, the mill and meat chopper were discontinued as electricity replaced water power. The sawmill, which had been in operation since 1759, was shut down in 1930, and the dam pond was covered over in 1941.<br/>In 1564, another mill was built between Breitenaach and Hellmühle, but it had to be demolished after a few years at the behest of the court.<br/><br/>6th Bergermühle:<br/>In 1593, it was built with the permission of the Federal Bailiff, but he was not responsible for this permission. Complaints led to the mill being \"no longer allowed to be built without higher permission as soon as it starts to decline\". After the water level in the Hudelmoos was lowered, the mill had too little water and ceased to operate as a farmers' mill in 1884. Cattle feed was still ground until 1910.<br/><br/>7. Obermüli:<br/>The \"Jompferegonte\" had been created as a mill pond. The sluice gate and the inlet of the canal are still visible at the end of the forest. Its course at the foot of the embankment to the mill can be guessed.<br/>First mentioned in 1394 as a fief of the Bishop of Constance to the Bischofszell hospital. In 1697, an oat kiln and a bakery are also mentioned, both of which still exist 20 years later. Two water wheels are mentioned. Around 1900, the business was abandoned.<br/><br/>8. Mülibach Mill:<br/>The place name first appears in 969, so there must have been a mill even then. In 1460 this is itself mentioned. In 1600, a court heard that the miller Laib von Mülibach \"arbitrarily swelled\" the water. This meant that the mills further down the hill had too little water. A precise plan for damming the pond was drawn up and determined: \"He should saw off the Strümpfel (cone) in the pond so far down that it cannot be easily pushed away\". Milling continued until the end of the First World War.<br/><br/>9. Huebmühle:<br/>Shortly in existence in the 19th century, demolished.<br/>Former location: southeast courtyard, by the lone pear tree<br/><br/>10. Krapfen- or Neumühle:<br/>First mentioned in 1404, the mill was owned by the Krapf family for almost 500 years, first as a fief, from the 19th century as property. In 1732, a water dispute with the Rütimüller even occupied the session of the 8 old towns! In 1855, the mill passed to Johannes Schümperli, who supplied flour to bakeries as far away as Matzingen. At the beginning of the 20th century, operations were discontinued.<br/><br/>11. Rüti or Fürstenmühle:<br/>The St.Gallen hospital bought the Fürstenrüti farm with a mill in 1315. Later, the Lords of Salis zu Marschlins were the owners. Since 1835, it was in bourgeois hands and was only called \"Rütimühle\". Competition from large-scale enterprises meant that no more bread grain was milled around 1890 and 30 years later the mill ceased operating altogether.<br/><br/><strong>Note(s)</strong><br/>Caution when crossing the main roads!<br/><br/>",

            "description_long": "Experience the unique feeling of riding an electric bike and discover three highlights of Eastern Switzerland: Lake Constance, Appenzellerland and the UNESCO World Heritage city of St. Gallen!<br/><br/>The technology of the FLYER electric bike offers around twice the power of conventional bikes, meaning that climbs and headwinds are no longer obstacles.<br/><br/>Pick up your FLYER electric bike at Romanshorn station. The first few kilometres lead idyllically along Lake Constance to Rorschach harbour and are ideal for getting used to the electric bike. Lake Constance is a Mecca for cyclists and the cycle route to Rorschach Hafen is well signposted from Romanshorn station.<br/><br/>On arrival in Rorschach Hafen, you can take a breather. Take your electric bike and change to the nostalgic mountain railway, which will take you up the 523 metres in altitude to the Biedermeier village of Heiden in just over 20 minutes. In Heiden, we recommend a short tour of the classicist Biedermeier village, climbing the Häädler church tower with a fantastic view of the southern German shore and the Bregenz Bay, or a visit to the Henry Dunant Museum or the Natural History Museum.<br/><br/>From Heiden, the tour takes you via Oberegg up to the St. Anton lookout point. The ascent is easy thanks to the electric bike, so that when you reach the top you still have enough energy to enjoy the unique view down into the Rhine valley and over to the Alpstein mountains. Speaking of energy: If necessary, you can exchange your empty battery for a full one in the St. Anton restaurant.<br/><br/>The following kilometres promise true riding pleasure! Feel the refreshing wind filled with soothing Appenzell mountain air. From St. Anton, you ride gently downhill to the former Landsgemeinde village of Trogen. Discover the Landsgemeindeplatz with the baroque Grubenmann Church or visit the Pestalozzi Children's Village.<br/><br/>A short distance along the main road you reach the village of Speicher, where your cycle path branches off to the left towards Teufen before the village centre. If you are interested in the masterpieces of 18th century carpentry, we recommend a visit to the Grubenmann collection in Teufen.<br/><br/>From Teufen you continue through the typical Appenzell hilly landscape to Haslen and then you descend to the bed of the Sitter stream. You cross an old wooden bridge and begin the ascent to Stein. In Stein, a stop at the Appenzell show dairy is definitely worthwhile. You can also replace your empty battery with a full one here if necessary. We also recommend a visit to the Appenzell Folklore Museum.<br/><br/>The 98-metre high Haggen Bridge shortly after Stein spans the Sitter and is the gateway to the city of St. Gallen. You leave the Appenzellerland and cross the urban residential area of St. Gallen Haggen. The well-signposted cycle path from Haggen station leads you safely into the city centre to St. Gallen main station. Here you get off your electric bike and return it to the SBB luggage counter. Discover the capital of eastern Switzerland with its world-famous abbey district on foot.<br/><br/><strong>Note(s)</strong><br/>The numerous Appenzell restaurants along the route look forward to your visit and will be happy to spoil you with local specialities. Various homely inns are the ideal place to end the day in style after an eventful electric bike tour and recharge your batteries. <br/><br/>The Appenzell Electric Bike Tour is specially signposted from Heiden as a local Switzerland Mobile route with the number 998. <br/><br/>Rental station:<br/>Romanshorn railway station<br/>Railway counter<br/><br/>Return station:<br/>St Gallen main railway station<br/>Luggage counter<br/><br/>Battery exchange stations:<br/>Tourist Information Heiden<br/>Restaurant St. Anton, Oberegg (closed on Wednesdays)<br/>Appenzell show dairy, Stein<br/><br/>",

The tour starts in Schönengrund and climbs immediately. There are just under 400 metres of altitude to climb to Hochhamm. Once you reach the top, you don't regret the effort.

            "description_long": "Romanshorn, with its wonderful location on Lake Constance, its intact hinterland and its ideal location in terms of transport, is a unique starting point for great cycling tours. The accessibility with intercity connections, the regional train THURBO, Lake Constance shipping and the ferry connection to Germany makes Romanshorn an Eldorado not only for \"Velo- and Skater's Paradise\", but for the entire slow traffic. Trips to the skate and bike paradise of Thurgau start and end here. The numerous leisure activities in and on the water as well as the rich catering and accommodation offer round off an unforgettable stay in Romanshorn.<br/><br/>The cycle tour \"3 castles\" leads from Romanshorn through the beautiful hinterland with its orchards to Arbon and back to Romanshorn. The approximately 24 km long bike tour is easy and leisurely. The 3 castles of Roggwil, Arbon and Luxburg can be marvelled at as historical highlights. For the return journey from Arbon to Romanshorn, you can also use the THURBO regional train or a Lake Constance boat. Sporty people can of course also cycle back to Romanshorn along the shore of Lake Constance. <br/><br/>Info Arbon Castle: The fortified late Roman fort Arbor Felix (\"the happy tree\") dates back to 250 AD, but the Romans had to leave it again at the time of the migration of peoples around 400 AD. For over a thousand years, episcopal administrators and later senior bailiffs lived in the castle. After extensive interior and exterior restorations, the castle with its 33-metre high, distinctive tower has been home to the historical museum for over 30 years. <br/><br/>Info Roggwil Castle: Roggwil Castle is a baroque country castle from the early 17th century, whose foundation walls probably date back to the 11th century. Situated between Arbon and St. Gallen, in the middle of the striking village centre of rural Roggwil, it has recently undergone extensive renovation in keeping with its status as a listed building. <br/><br/>Info Luxburg Castle: Old moated castle in private ownership.<br/><br/>Tip: In Romanshorn, visit the beautiful lake park and the largest Lake Constance harbour on the Swiss side!<br/><br/>",

At the old, but well-maintained iron bridge, we leave the Rhine dam briefly, but return to it at the wayside cross. After half an hour through the agriculturally used plain, we reach the southernmost point of the hike. Here, in 1923, the Rhine was diverted from the old river loop into the now straightened river bed. We turn left and follow the old course of the river. Let's take our time to enjoy the nature reserve! The calm waters are mainly inhabited by carp. For ornithologists, the bird life is of great interest: nightingale, oriole, common tern or whinchat are worth mentioning. Water lilies, irises, orchid and common skipping weed delight the botanist.

The castle, which is over 450 years old, has had many owners.

Worth mentioning are the mighty old town hall with its striking timber-framed building and the 17th century chimney in the house to the west of the «Sternen». <br/><br/>In a westerly direction, the hiking trail leads into the Wissbach Gorge.

We walk past the powder huts until the markings point us into the ravine. At the footbridge, our path branches off to the right and leads along the natural stream through damp, loamy slopes to the Giessenfall. Mostly a harmless channel, the stream can flood after thunderstorms. We bypass the natural spectacle via steps and follow the beautifully laid out path to Dietschwil. On a meadow path we climb to the Schallenberg, where a beautiful panoramic view of the Alpine world awaits us. Through the hamlet of Schalkhusen we reach Kirchberg. In addition to Kirchberg, the villages of Bazenheid and Gauml;hwil also belong to the Alttoggenburg municipality. We take a look at the Catholic church Heiligkreuz, which was built in 1748-51. For the last section of our hike, we use the road that runs east-west along the church, but immediately turn right onto a side path and enjoy the beautiful view as far as Bazenheid.<br/><br/><br/></p>",

The cathedral alone with its huge organ is worth a visit. During our tour, we cycle very close to the river bank for the most part, changing sides every now and then via a bridge or with a ferry. If we pass Oberzell on the opposite side of the Danube, we can consider taking the ferry to visit the old town. Otherwise, we continue cycling along the bank. For the Jochenstein Danube power station, where we cross the Danube again, we take a few minutes. We can see the huge dam wall from afar. The five turbines in the power station building, which we can see well through the window, generate so much electrical energy through water power that a city like Passau can be well supplied. We continue along the Danube until we reach the natural spectacle \"Schlögener Donauschlinge\". The river winds particularly narrowly here, and the Danube has cut deep into the mountains. The valley next to the river offers just enough space for a cycle path. The amazing thing is that the Danube flows directly in the opposite direction here twice in a row, which we can observe particularly well from the Haichenbach ruins, also known as the \"Kerschbaumer Schlössl\"  ",

The imposing view of the entire Alpstein, whose three mountain ranges come together on the Säntis, rewards the effort. The matt green hills with views into Appenzellerland show the beauty of the scattered settlement from a special side. Now follow the signpost towards Oberriet. The upcoming descent through the Kobelwald offers views of the expanse of the Rhine valley. Halfway up, a sign points to the crystal cave. A short detour is worthwhile. Once you reach the valley floor, cycle along the main road for a short distance to the Eichberg, where a separate cycle path has been laid out. The historic market town of Altstätten with its cosy alleys and houses worth seeing forms the centre of the region. The Appenzell railways will take you up the arduous climb back to Appenzell.<br/><br/><strong>Note(s)</strong><br/>- The tour is well suited for families<br/>- The bike can be loaded conveniently in Altstätten, the Appenzell railways regularly offer a special carriage.<br/><br/>",

At the «Chaschtenloch» we have reached the geographically lowest point. Morally, the impressive natural landscape and the rustic, cosy inn are inspiring. Appenzellerland is known for its constant ups and downs. So it is not surprising that the next few kilometres to the vantage point of St. Anton (refreshments available) require a lot of muscle power. Once you have reached the top, Lake Constance and the St. Gallen Rhine Valley come back into view. Finally, you can enjoy the descent back to Heiden.</p>",

Follow the lane before soon taking a left through shady shrubbery, and then continue for a short distance until you reach Eugst. The wide ski trail goes to «Alp Bommen» and up to the «Gartenwald» (garden forest). When you come to a fork in the trail, take a left and enjoy a beautiful panoramic view of Kamor, Hoher Kasten and the long rock face of Alp Sigel. The «Berggasthaus Äscher» mountain inn will also suddenly come into view, nestled up directly into the vertical rock face on the east side of the Ebenalp. Walk over the wooden bridge firmly secured to the steep rock face until you come to the Wildkirchli caves, first reaching the altar cave in front of which there stands a wooden bell tower from the 19th century. Then follow the caves until you reach the Ebenalp. The Wildkirchli caves have become world-famous, thanks to prehistoric findings dating back to the Stone Age. Skeletons of cave bears and stone tools are evidence that hunters lived here in prehistoric times. These findings are exhibited at the Appenzell Local History Museum (Heimatmuseum Appenzell) and at the Historical and Ethnological Museum of St. Gallen (Historisches und Völkerkundemuseum). After visiting the caves ascend to the plateau of the Ebenalp. Take some time for yourself and enjoy the impressive panoramic view before taking the cable car back down to the valley.<br/><br/><strong>Note(s)</strong><br/>Mountain inns: Äscher, Ebenalp<br/><br/><strong>See also</strong><br/>For Supported Areas<br/>GEO-Tracks GmbH<br/>Zugerstrasse 1<br/>CH-6330 Cham<br/>Web: www.gps-tracks.com<br/>E-Mail: touren@gps-tracks.com<br/><br/>",

The trail continues slightly downhill to the blue-green Sämtiser lake. The mountain lake with its pleasant water temperature invites you to swim and linger. The hike continues along the shore of the lake. At the end of the lake you climb northwards to Lawannen and Alp Soll. Via the Mädi-Hasenplatte alp rights, the trail leads to the Ruhsitz mountain inn. A splendid view into the heart of the Alpstein massif and, in fine weather, far out to sea, make the short climb worthwhile. The path to the Hoher Kasten crosses here. The descent goes over pastures of the Rossberg to the year-round inhabited farmhouses with steep mountain slopes down to Brülisau.<br/><br/></p>",

After a short stroll through the alpine meadow, an ascent will take you through the Huttentobel ravine. In the green beech forest the trickling sounds of the mountain stream will accompany you up to «Alp Hütten», where the view opens up to reveal a magnificent mountain landscape. Then enjoy a pleasant walk to «Alp Waldhütte», where you'll enjoy a view of Säntis, the highest mountain in the Alpstein massif. In the meantime, you'll have hardly noticed that the picturesque Seealpsee lake lies right before you. Take a relaxing stroll around the lake, walking along the left side of the shore, and see the countless little alpine huts scattered at the base of the large «Seealp». On the other side of the lake, walk until you reach the lake's outlet. Two cosy mountain inns invite you to come in and stay a while. More sentimental walkers will also enjoy a pleasant cable car ride surrounded by the magnificent mountain backdrop. In a sparse forest along the lake, almost hidden from view, you'll see the Bruder Klaus mountain chapel. Make your descent along the overhanging rock face to Chobel. The ravine of the «Schwendibach» stream lies below you to the right. The trail goes past Appenzell's water and power plant, and into the valley to Wasserauen.<br/><br/><strong>Note(s)</strong><br/>Mountain inns: Seealpsee, Forelle.

Via the Berndlibach - Grossberndli and Schwizerälpli the ascent leads to the highest point of the round tour, the upper Borstböhl. The route continues comfortably to the Potersalp communal alps. Every year at alpine time, the Potersalp Stobete, organised by the alpine dairymen, takes place at Dreihütten. On the gravel road you hike down to the Böhlwald. After an extensive hike through the forest, you come to the Leuenfall. Here the waters of the Berndlibach torrent thunder into the depths and shortly afterwards merge with the Wissbach.

At the end of the lake the trail will go up to the left through the picturesque mixed forest to the ridges along the «Unterstrich». You'll soon arrive at the idyllic alpine dairy-farming village of Meglisalp. The rest of the trail is rather steep as you head southeast to the «Bötzelsattel», crossing from there to the «Widderalpsattel» at nearly the same altitude. Then enjoy a gentle descent from the «Widderalp». Take a right before reaching the forest and you'll arrive at the «Stiefelfelsen» («boot rock»). As you pass this rock, there is a short ascent to where a spectacular view awaits you: the Fälensee lake shimmering before your eyes, embedded between steep rocky cliffs. By now you'll have reached the «Berggasthaus Bollenwees» mountain inn. As you approach the valley along a little lane, you'll cross «Alp Furgglen» and go through the mountain forest to reach the Sämtisersee lake. Like the Fälensee lake, there is no visible outlet since the water from both lakes flows underground and surfaces in the Rheintal valley. After a short ascent on the other side to the «Berggasthaus Plattenbödeli» mountain inn, follow the steep descent through the Brüeltobel ravine, passing the «Hexenwäldli» («witch's forest») down to Brülisau.<br/><br/><strong>Note(s)</strong><br/>The trail can be followed in both directions.<br/>Mountain inns: Seealpsee, Forelle, Meglisalp, Bollenwees, Plattenbödeli.<br/><br/><strong>See also</strong><br/>For Supported Areas<br/>GEO-Tracks GmbH<br/>Zugerstrasse 1<br/>CH-6330 Cham<br/>Web: www.gps-tracks.com<br/>E-Mail: touren@gps-tracks.com<br/><br/>",

At the end of the lake, the trail leads up to the left to the rocky ledges at Unterstrich. On this path you reach the dreamy alpine dairy village of Meglisalp. Head south via Oberchellen-Schafmad uphill to the Rotsteinpass. With a bit of luck, you may spot some ibex or even a herd of chamois up here. A delightful alpine ridge hike leads over the Lisengrat to the Säntis. The Säntis is the highest peak in the Alpstein. You will find the descent on the west side, near the railway station. Through a rock tunnel you reach the rock staircase with good steps and wire rope protection. First you cross the Blaue Schnee and head east across cart fields and good paths to the Höch Niderisattel. On the north side, traverse to the right of the Öhrli, to the front Öhrligrueb and hike to the Lötzlisalpsattel. On the south side you pass under the rock walls of the Altenalp towers and soon, after a short counter-climb, you are on the Schäfler. The final descent leads via Chlus to Ebenalp and with the cable car you float comfortably down into the valley to Wasserauen.<br/><br/><strong>Note(s)</strong><br/>Catering:<br/>- Berggasthaus Seealp<br/>- Berggasthaus Forelle<br/>- Berggasthaus Meglisalp<br/>- Berggasthaus Rotsteinpass<br/>- Berggasthaus Alter Säntis<br/>- Berggasthaus Säntis<br/>- Berggasthaus Schäfler<br/>- Berggasthaus Ebenalp<br/><br/>",

The Ebenalp cable car takes you comfortably to the starting point of this mountain tour. The trail climbs gently between mountain pines and alpine rose bushes southwards to Chlus. Then follow the steep, well-maintained path on the southern slope to the Schäfler mountain inn. From the inn westwards, the route leads northwards around the Schäfler summit to the well-secured short descent and along the south walls of the Läden and Altenalp towers. Slightly descending, you reach the Steckenbergsattel and via Lötzlisälpli the Messmer mountain inn. Zigzag up 300 metres to the rock path through the Ageteplatte. On the Rossmad ridge you experience an unforgettable panoramic view in the heart of the Alpstein all the way up to the Säntis. Then descend to the Säntisweg trail on which you reach Meglisalp. From there, head out of the valley along the Unterstrichweg trail down to the Seealpsee lake and from there back to Wasserauen.<br/><br/><strong>Note(s)</strong><br/>Refreshments:<br/>- Ebenalp mountain inn<br/>- Schäfler mountain inn<br/>- Messmer mountain inn<br/>- Meglisalp mountain inn<br/>- Seealp mountain inn<br/>- Forelle mountain inn<br/><br/>",

The name comes from the time when the countries of Bavaria, Baden and Wurttemberg were still distinguished. Together with Switzerland and Austria, this makes five countries. The panoramic view of Lake Constance and the Vorarlberg mountains is overwhelming. From Fünderblick, the route leads down ürt via Unterbilchen and along a beautiful forest path to Landegg - Wienacht. Wienacht, a health resort and holiday village, is situated on a mountain promontory, 300 m above Lake Constance. In about 10 minutes you reach the Wienacht Tobel railway station on the Rorschach-Heiden line. A detour to the hamlet of «Tobel» is worthwhile. Here you can visit the old Appenzeller settlement with wooden houses from the 17th century, all of which are under heritage protection. A short tour of the only vineyard in Appenzell Ausserrhoden concludes this memorable hike.<br/><br/></p>",

The ascent to the Höhenweg runs along a tarred road for the first quarter of an hour. With good visibility, you can see far across Lake Constance from there. Then turn left up to the edge of the forest where a gravel path leads through the Steineggerwald. You are now on the high trail, which leads up and down along the ridge. At the hamlet of Oberhorst, the path climbs to the meadow ridge - with a view of the entire Alpstein chain. A first highlight is the Waldegg. It is worth visiting the interior of the inn. Through forest and pastures you hike to Schäflisegg. Continue to Fröhlichsegg, where there is a large picnic area with tables Bänken and a fireplace. The trail descends over meadow paths to the Gstalden junction and then along a path down to the Lustmühle.<br/><br/><br/></p>",

First you cross the highest point, then you descend via Ochsenhöhi-Chuterenegg. Continue leisurely along the ridge to the Himmelberg property. In an easterly direction you cross the shade forest and later follow the edge of the forest down to Fluchtrank.

On this adventure tour you will pass fascinating buildings, old half-timbered houses, small fishing villages and the Napoleon Castle Arenenberg as well as Wolfsberg Castle. <br/><br/>Various experience stations offer hands-on agriculture. <br/><br/>The tour starts at the town hall in Steckborn. From there, drive along Seestraße and turn into Frauenfelder Straße. Follow the course of the road to a fork and now turn left onto the steeply ascending road along the forest and meadows. This will take you on the direct path to Reutenen. Turn left into Kapellenweg and you will reach the Rüütemer Besenbeizli, whose homemade sausage and smoked specialities and regional cheese range are not only well-known on the Seerücken. You can also shop in the farm shop or treat yourself to a night in the straw. <br/><br/>Go back onto Haidenhausstrasse and turn right onto Rennentalstrasse. You will pass through Büren, Fischbach and Helsighausen. In Helsighausen, drive straight on into Lindenstrasse and turn left outside Helsighausen into Wolfsbergstrasse.<br/><br/>The road leads directly past Wolfsberg Castle, which is mainly used as a conference and further education centre, but is also known for its art and cultural offerings. The castle garden with its wonderful view and the changing flower beds is freely accessible to visitors. It is part of the \"Garten Kult-Tour am Untersee\" series, which leads to a total of 10 small garden paradises around Untersee.<br/><br/>You continue along Wolfsbergstrasse, turn right onto Furthwilerstrasse, right onto Hauptstrasse and first left onto Kirchgasse, then right, first left again, this takes you onto Standbadstrasse, where you cross the railway line, then follow the signs for the Bodenseerundweg in the direction of Manenbach-Salenstein. Before Mannenbach, you will find Arenenberg Castle, affectionately known as \"the most beautiful castle on Lake Constance\", on a hill. Emperor Napoleon III grew up here, where Queen Hortense, the stepdaughter of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, lived. The Napoleon Museum at Arenenberg Castle brings imperial court life back to life. The castle park with typical 19th-century woodland, a round water basin and various sculptures is also part of the \"Garden Cult Tour\". From here you can experience an indescribably beautiful sunset in the evening hours. Right next door is the Arenenberg Agricultural Centre, which offers an agricultural nature trail with information boards on the subjects of fruit and wine growing, arable farming and vegetable cultivation. A tour of the wine cellar with tasting is also offered (registration required). The Bistro Louis Napoleon offers refreshments for the onward journey. <br/><br/>From Arenenberg Castle, the tour continues along the Bodensee circular route to Mannenbach and Berlingen. A visit to the most important Swiss painter Adolf Dietrich (1877-1957) is almost a must, whether in his painting room or in his neighbour's garden, which he immortalised in numerous paintings. <br/><br/>From Berlingen, continue to follow the signs for the Lake Constance cycle path back towards Steckborn. Before you reach Steckborn, you will see the Besenbeiz Jochtal on the left-hand side, where you can enjoy freshly pressed sweet cider (depending on the season) and your own wine, along with small dishes of cheese, meat and sausage.<br/><br/>Freshly fortified, you then continue along the Seestraße, past the harbour, until you reach your starting point again in Steckborn, the town hall.<br/><br/>",

On top of the yellowish tuff-limestone rock, small waterfalls flow harmoniously into the stream in the valley. This is an amazing, beautiful and special natural phenomenon that is worth seeing. <strong>The tuff rock found in this route is considered the largest of its kind in Europe north of the Alps!</strong></p><p style=\";text-align:left;direction:ltr\"> The hiking route starts on the plain and passes next to some houses located on the outskirts of the village (you have to park near the T-intersection of roads 205 and 6 since the access road that reaches the beginning of the trail is for tenants only and there is no parking there). Further on there is a descent on an asphalt road that very quickly connects to a natural path from which wooden steps descend leading to the viewing promenade on the tuff stone. Please note that the nature of the trail is not accessible to wheelchairs or strollers, but with supervision children can also navigate it.</p><p style=\";text-align:left;direction:ltr\"> In order to easily find the point where the route starts, it is recommended to open the map attached to this route in the <a href=\"https://www.outdooractive.com/he/mobile-app.html\">Outdootactive app</a> .</p>",

The tour is not particularly difficult from a technical point of view, but it is demanding from a physical point of view. There are no refreshment stops until the end of the tour, which is why it is highly recommended to take enough provisions with you. Surefootedness is required on the last 100m to the two summits. The path is not clearly visible here and should be chosen freely according to your own assessment. However, safety equipment is not required.

            "description_long": "A circular walking route leading to the impressive Riesach Falls, rich in views, water and other surprises such as a suspension bridge. Riesach Falls are considered the highest among Styria's waterfalls, with the highest among them falling from a height of more than 70 meters. The walk to the lower waterfall takes about 10 minutes, while the walk to the upper waterfall takes about half an hour (with owners). Depending on personal ability, the route can also be followed one-way, that is, return the same way back (or cut through the small observation bridge and complete a small circular route), but it is recommended to complete the circular route through the suspension bridge that passes over the stream. Since the route includes climbing stairs, it is not accessible to strollers. A great itinerary for those who love wild nature and water.",

In addition to this and considering that the walk on the route is steep and occasionally includes several steps and climbing on small rocks, it is not accessible to wheelchairs or strollers.</p><p style=\";text-align:left;direction:ltr\"> The route is linear (one-way) but it is possible at any point to turn around and retrace the steps, but it is recommended to complete the route and only then come back as there are points of interest worth seeing all along it. You can start the route from both sides, if you are traveling with more than one vehicle, you can leave a collection vehicle on one side of the route, but walking the round trip route is recommended as it extends your stay in this wonderful place and gives a different and interesting angle on this lovely route.</p>",

The total length of the circular route is about 6 kilometers, but it can actually be done in a linear way and you can only visit some of the points, when the first view point overlooking the Alps is only <strong>500 meters away</strong> from the parking lot, which means an average walking time of about 15 minutes on a moderate incline. The second view point is about a ten minute walk from the first point and overlooks the town's two large lakes: Groser Alfaza (translated into Hebrew: the large lake of the Alps) and Kleiner Alfaza (translated into Hebrew: the small lake of the Alps). From the second lookout, you can return the same way back to the car or extend the route and go down towards Grocer Alfaza lake and then go back the same way or make the road circular and pass the Kleiner Alfaza lake and from there through the town to return to the starting point.</p>",

It covers an area of 184.4 hectares and is located on a gravel plain from the Upper Cretaceous period. There are a total of 10 lakes and ponds in the area, not all of which are freely accessible. <br/>Both flora and fauna in this area are remarkable: With a little luck, walkers will encounter hedgehogs, squirrels and different species of ducks and geese, and there are also various species of trees such as sycamore and English oak and a variety of shrubs to discover. It is also worth taking a look at the water: pike, zander and chub feel at home in the waters. The trail also passes a protected deadwood area and thus offers not only recreation in the fresh air but also instructive insights into the animal and plant world. <br/>If you fancy a bit of a change of pace along the way, you can jump into the bathing lake, take a break at the nearby mini-golf course or stop off at Charly's Auwirt after your walk. ",

The hiking route is linear, on the way the walk is downhill which you will have to climb on the way back (reasonable slope). It itself is not long, but the terrain conditions make walking on it somewhat challenging and it is therefore important to pay attention to where you are walking. Also, the nature of the road makes it inaccessible to strollers/wheelchairs. The destination of the route is the impressive waterfall and the walk through the forest itself is absolutely beautiful.</p><p style=\";text-align:left;direction:ltr\"> There is another, longer road leading to the waterfall next to watercourses starting from the village of Niedersonthofen.</p>",

We continue and soon find ourselves on a tarred road again. We look for the way into the forest to enjoy the forest path (Alpenvereinsweg) running parallel to the ridge. Here we find oodles of interesting spots for the little hikers among us: steps, bumpy paths, large and small roots and a waterfall.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to drive up the mountain itself, but the old Kirchheimer road, which circles the mountain, still offers great scenery and views of the entire Ries. From here we circle the Ipf and reach Oberdorf. Here we have to navigate a little through the village, just like shortly after in Aufhausen. This is where the Eger fountain is located. From Aufhausen on, the paths change. Up to now we were mainly on tarred paths and open spaces. From now on, we are going on the wooded slopes of the Swabian Alb. The ascent leads us over winding gravel paths up to the Sandberg, the highest point on our stage. After that it is mostly downhill on partly trail-like paths until we arrive in Trochtelfingen and finally in Pflaumloch again",

Behind the Osterholz rises the Ipf, a witness mountain of the Swabian Alp, which centuries ago housed a Celtic castle. Unfortunately, the mountain is not allowed to be ridden on by bicycle, which is why we turn north-east from here towards Kirchheim. There, the Blasienberg, the highest elevation of the tour, is on the program. Afterwards we will cycle along the edge of the Ries on great field paths over the plateau of the Goldberg back to Plaumloch.</p>",

The climb is also very popular among racing cyclists and pushes some of them to their limits. Once you reach the top, you can enjoy the view of the Bregenz Forest.

All nature discoverers are invited to take part in the bird quiz. The quiz sheets are available at the beginning of the nature trail or as a PDF file on the internet at http://www.vgem-eggenthal.de.\r\n<br/>The trail is suitable for prams and wheelchairs.

In the extension of this road, a path leads between two houses into the meadow landscape with individual, scattered trees and rows of trees. On this path we walk along a slope that is home to many protected orchid species and rare insects. An intact cultural landscape has also been preserved here, about which we can learn from 15 information boards along the way. They explain, for example, why steep slope farming was necessary for survival in the past, or how the wealth of the builder can be read from the typical dry stone walls that delimit the fields here. On our way we meet a herd of dwarf zebu cattle, a breed that also eats dry grass. In a wooded area we come to a crossroads where we turn right and soon meet a wider path. We follow it for a bit, but then turn right again into the meadow landscape and return to our starting point on the outskirts of Creglingen. After the tour, it is worth taking a detour into Creglingen's town centre. In addition to numerous places to stop for refreshments, such as the \"Grüner Baum\" restaurant, there are also many historical buildings and museums here, such as the Lindlein Museum in the old defence and watchtower, or the Jewish Museum.",

            "description_long": "We head south from the market square between the church and the town hall on Prinzenstraße. After one kilometre we have already arrived at the Lorettokapelle (1). It is worth looking at the beautiful pilgrimage chapels from the inside. In the small Appach chapel, old frescoes from 1700 have been uncovered. The Marienkapelle has a wealth of sculptures and the most beautiful rococo altar in the upper Allgäu. In the Josef Chapel we see a rich collection of Baroque works of art, including a palm tree from 1729. We then climb back into the saddle and continue to the Scheibenhaus, where we turn half-left into Obstbaum-Allee. This path leads us dead straight in a southerly direction into the Stillach valley until we meet the road to Spielmannsau. Here we cross the road and continue through the avenue to the Zimmeroy bridge (2). Continue uphill on the left side of the Stillach dam. Before we get to the bridge subway, we can take a look at the Heini Klopfer ski jump. The tower is 72 m high and the run-up track to the jumping hill is 139 m long. At the take-off hill, we can see the current ski jump record displayed on a sign. Behind the subway we cycle further left of the Stillach. Through the forest we reach the \"escape\" (avalanche roof), slightly ascending. We now continue parallel to the asphalt road to Anatsstein. Here we cross the asphalt road and continue on the old Birgsau road to Birgsau (3). Here we have the opportunity to stop for a break and refreshment in the inns before we continue our journey. Before the chapel of Birgsau, we keep to the right and use the asphalt road along the Stillach for the return journey for just under 2 km. At the same junction as before, keep left and take the narrow footbridge across the Stillach in the direction of Faistenoy to the Fellhornbahn valley station (4). There the trail leads us slowly uphill via Ringang to Schwand. Here, too, there is the possibility of a stop at Gasthof Schwand, from where we can also really enjoy the wonderful mountain scenery once again. In Schwand you can take a strenuous and steep, but worthwhile detour to the Freibergsee lake (6) and also to the start-up tower of the ski jump. The climb is compensated by a fantastic distant view of the Allgäu mountains. Our route takes us back towards Oberstdorf in Schwand. Soon we get back to the junction before Schwand, where we keep left downhill. We descend steeply with caution. When we reach the plain, we are directly at the outlet of the Heini-Klopfer-Skiflugschanze. Here we have another opportunity to comfortably reach the foot of the ski jump by chairlift. Afterwards, a lift in the tower leads to the upper platform, where a magnificent mountain panorama opens up to us. Further out of the valley, we finally cycle through the avenue to the Zimmeroy Bridge, which we cross. Immediately after the bridge, we now stay on the right bank embankment, which we only leave again at the Renksteg car park. Here we cross the asphalt road and continue towards Burgstall. At the avenue that we passed through at the beginning of our tour, we keep to the left and cycle along it back to Oberstdorf. We return to our starting point at the market square on the same route as the outward journey. Now nothing stands in the way of an extensive stroll through the town and a rest in one of the numerous cafés and restaurants.",

Shortly afterwards we reach the charcoal pile, which is operated for demonstration purposes. At the next fork we pass a nice place to rest. We can also rest here by the stream on the way back. The path later meets an asphalt road, which we follow to the right for a short while and then turn directly to the right. As we learn from an information board, the Austrian mail line used to run here. After a long climb, we now turn right onto a narrower path. The trail now leads well signposted through the forest. On the left side of the path is a nice resting place at a spring. Soon we reach the outward route and walk back the way we came.",

On the tour into the Oytal valley, the steep, almost vertical grassy flanks of the Höfats are impressive. The tour leads us on an asphalted alpine, forest and carriage path to the Oytalhaus excursion restaurant and from there on a gravel road to the serviced Käseralpe at 1401 m above sea level. Here we can enjoy the fantastic view of the Höfats in peace and quiet.",
            "description_long": "The tour is clearly signposted throughout with the number 2. Regardless of the direction from which we reach the valley station of the Nebelhorn cable car, the road leads us from there first south and then up to the left to the ski stadium, visible from afar, with its new ski jumps built for the Nordic World Ski Championships 2005. Turn sharp right and follow the asphalt path up into the Oytal valley and enjoy the view of the main ridge of the Allgäu Alps. At the Oytalhaus we have to share the road with hikers, walkers and horse-drawn carriages on a sunny afternoon. Continue straight ahead on a gravel path that initially climbs only slightly with short asphalt passages that leads past the Gutenalpe to the Prinzenkreuz. After crossing the stream, a crisp ascent awaits us. From here, there is still a good 300 metres of altitude to conquer to the Käseralpe. On the way, the spray of the Stuiben Falls envelops the trail in wafts of mist and provides a mostly welcome refreshment. A few hairpin bends further on, we reach the high plateau of the valley basin, which is grazed from the alp. The Käseralpe is the starting point for several interesting mountain tours. The ascent of the Höfats is only recommended to experienced, well-equipped alpinists, but normal hikers can also reach the entrance at the Älpelesattel. A little further uphill is the Eissee lake, which lives up to its name even in summer. It is not advisable to cross the Älpelesattel by bicycle into the Dietersbachtal valley.",

Following the sign, we come to a crossroads at the level of the radio converter, where we turn right. After about 200 m, a red arrow shows us the way to the Käsbrunnen on the left. Saumahdbrunnen and Käsbrunnen are springs that were formed due to clay-like, impermeable layers. The name \"Käsbrunnen\" refers to the milky appearance of the water due to the lime that has been washed into it. At the Käsbrunnen, walk 50 m further along the path, then turn right on a grassy path downhill until you reach a gravel path. There we keep left until we reach a fork, where we turn left to the Wagnersgruben, a former Bohnerz pit. Bohner ore partly covered the demand for iron until the 19th century. Today the Wagnersgruben are a biotope in idyllic surroundings. Continue straight ahead on the Wagnersgrubenweg until you reach the radio transformer, where you turn right onto a trail marked with a red arrow to the Saumahdbrunnen well. The former farmstead on the site of the \"Saumahdbrunnen\" probably had meadows and raised pigs. From there we go back to the gravel road (Saumahdweg), which we follow for about 1.5 km. Turning left into the Buchschorrenweg, we return to the starting point via the Viehtal. On the way back we can stop at the Homöopathenhäusle.",

            "description_long": "We start our tour at the fairground in Roding and leave it on the road heading east. We soon come to a roundabout where we cross the main road. On the opposite side, a road leads us out of the town. We are now on the Regental cycle path, which takes us to Wetterfeld. Here it is worth making a detour to the castle ruins, which were built as early as 1100 and destroyed by the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War. We leave the town and follow the \"Radwanderweg 28\" tour markings, which will accompany us the whole way. On the section of the path towards Wulfing, we enjoy the wide view over the Regental nature reserve all the way to Cham. Soon we leave the Regental cycle path and ride up the hill to the right. We pass a few stations of a Way of the Cross that has its destination at the Sträucherröhren Chapel, which we can visit. However, our path turns left just below the chapel and leads us along the edge of the forest to eleven fish ponds in a row. We reach a road where we turn right and reach Schorndorf via Obertraubenbach and Nanzing. In Schorndorf we can stop at the Kraus inn and fortify ourselves for the climb that now lies ahead. The inn is opposite the Catholic parish church, which is dedicated to the Immaculate Conception of Mary. Behind the church we turn left and reach the Hornauerweg via Neuhauser Straße. We leave Schorndorf on this road. We descend a steep road, turn left at its end and after an ascent we reach Unteraigen. In the village we continue to the left until we reach Oberaign. There we keep to the right. Now the characteristics of the route change. Steeper mountain stages are followed by shorter descents. Via Ponholz and Bucherhof we reach Michelsneukirchen. From a distance we can already see the steeple of the parish church of St. Michael and enter the village from the east. No fewer than four inns invite you to stop for a bite to eat here and should satisfy the taste of every cyclist. At the church, which dates from around 1700, we turn left and bear right again at the end of the village. We climb an incline and reach the highest point of our tour. We then descend through a forest to Schrötting. In the valley, on the left, is the Gutshof Brewery, which is bordered by a game reserve. At the crossroads we turn right up the hill, past a cattle pasture and cross the Fichtenbach stream. Another climb takes us to Kalsing, where we keep left. The village lies on a plateau on the Plattenhöhberg. We leave the village and can now look forward to many beautiful descents in the last section of our tour. The trail leads us through spruce forest down to Grub. We pass through the hamlet. At the crossroads, the road leads us to the right in a northerly direction. After about 500 m we turn onto a path and get back onto the road via Eck and Oberlintach. The last kilometres to the destination of our tour are all downhill. Via Unterlintach we reach the first houses of the town of Roding. We turn left into Falkensteiner Straße, pass the Evangelical Lutheran Church built in 1953 and reach the centre of the town. Crossing the crossroads, we reach the old town and have earned a snack at Gasthof Lobmeyer, right next to the parish church of St. Pankratius, before we reach the fairground again and the destination of our bike tour.",

In Stuppach we come along Lindenstrasse and a small path to the parish church of St. Mary with its famous image of the Madonna. The painting by Matthias Grünewald, which hangs in a side altar of the church, is well worth seeing. Behind the Gothic church, which was built by the Teutonic Order in 1607, there is also a military cemetery. We walk back along Lindenstrasse, continue to the end of the village and leave Stuppach.

We turn left here and reach the Salzburg (2). We can take a break in the castle tavern in the courtyard. Continue along the ridge to the pulse measuring station (3). We reach the edge of the forest, turn right and cross a meadow to reach the road. Follow the road down to a fork to the left. We now walk along a path to Mühlbach, pass the Kneipp basin (4) and reach the car park again via a crossroads.",

In the second section, the path is very sunny.\nAfter the hike, a visit to the mountain church is a good idea. The Mariahilfberg owes its name to the pilgrimage church \"Maria Hilf\", where our hike begins. This has a long history, which began during the Thirty Years' War around 1633/34. The plague-stricken population of Amberg turned to the Virgin Mary in their distress and vowed to make annual pilgrimages if salvation would come. As a result, a chapel was built in 1641, which was enlarged in 1696 to become today's pilgrimage church in Baroque style. The building was completed in 1702 and consecrated in 1711. Since then, Mariahilfberg has been a popular destination for many pilgrimages. In addition, the church, which is run by the Franciscan Order, is the scene of the annual mountain festival week, which begins on the Feast of the Visitation of Mary on 02 July.\nOur hike continues past the so-called Kräuterbrünnerl, which used to supply water to the monastery next to the church. On our way we also pass historical devotional places and a wetland biotope maintained by the Bund-Naturschutz.",

At the beginning of the 20th century, the Tiefenbach priest Johannes Schiebel began to develop the gorge. Due to numerous rockfalls and floods, the gorge path was repeatedly badly damaged. However, the Breitachklamm Association spared no expense or effort and ensured that it was restored each time. In places the gorge is only 2 metres wide. This is why the water level rose to over 6 metres during the severe flood in August 2005.\n<p>At the lower ticket office is a part of the Oberstdorf mountain show. A special highlight here is a model of the Breitachklamm gorge that can be flooded with water to simulate different water levels. A 15-minute film provides information about the Breitachklamm, the work of the association and the mountain show.</p>",

At the height of the church we come to the main road. Turn right into this street and a little later turn right again into Färbergasse. From here we follow the red and white marker \"10\" on the street \"Insel\" to Maseringer Straße. Here we keep to the left and after a few metres we reach Passauer Straße. Cross the road and turn right on the other side along the footpath into the district of Preming. There we turn left into Pretzer Straße. Shortly afterwards, we turn right and walk up to the Preminger Höhe. From here we can enjoy the view: from Tittling over the Englburg to Fürstenstein. Then we walk down from the Preminger Höhe via Wildenberg to Pretz. At the fork in the road there, we make a short detour to the left to the small chapel of St. Kolomann. From there we go back to the fork in the road and continue straight on towards Neukirchen vorm Wald. We finally reach the St. Kolomann church. Turn left at the church, then immediately right again and cross the Dettenbach stream. Cross the Haseläcker to the next crossroads and turn left. After a few metres we reach the village of Hof. There we stay on the main road and finally reach Farnham. Behind it we come to a through road, cross it and continue straight ahead on the other side along the road in the direction of Enzersdorf and Witzmannsberg. Shortly afterwards, however, we leave the road again and turn right into the forest. We continue to follow the red and white markings and thus arrive at the Maria Bründl pilgrimage chapel, which is also popularly called the Bründl chapel because a wooden well house with a spring inside stood next to it. In 1976, the wooden house was replaced by a stone one as part of the land consolidation, in which a spring still bubbles. From the chapel, we reach Witzmannsberg in just a few steps. Shortly after entering the village, we come across the through road again and turn left into it. Behind the \"Zum Bründl\" inn, we turn right into Grafenring and then immediately left again into Weiherweg. Leave Witzmannsberg on this road and walk down to Niederham. About 250 m after leaving the village, we turn right and finally reach Anschiessing. Here we keep to the left and reach the through road again at the Tittlingen district of Siebenhasen. Cross the road and continue on the other side on the footpath to the right - via Muggenthaler and Carossastraße to Hafnergasse. Finally, we hike up opposite to the Blümersberg - one of the most beautiful vantage points in the Lower Bavarian Forest. Until 2001, the mountain had a height of 571 metres. By building a long-distance water reservoir on the hill, it was \"raised\" again by almost five metres. From the Blümersberg we continue on the gravel path to the asphalted road, where we turn left. At Herrenstraße we keep left again. Always straight ahead, we finally get back to the church at the market place of Tittling via Dreiburgenstraße. The Theodor-Heuss-Straße leads us from here back to our starting point.",

Those who still have enough energy can leave the restaurant on the left, cycle on and cross under the A8 motorway. On the forest road, we first go straight ahead and turn left at the first crossroads. Now we continue in a southerly direction until we reach the Lindenhöfe. Here we briefly leave the forest to disappear into it again directly behind the farmsteads. At Wolfschlugen, the forest clears again and we cross the main road. We reach Hardt via field paths, pass through a forest behind the village and then return to Wolfschlugen via field paths. We cross the town on Bergstraße and Klingenstraße, which takes us back to the edge of the forest, which we now follow for quite a while in the direction of Neuhausen auf den Fildern. Shortly before we reach the town, we continue along the forest in the direction of Denkendorf-Heerweg and cross under the A8 motorway again. Via Aicher Brühl we continue along the main road to Maierhof. Before this, we turn right and ride through the forest in the direction of Erlenhöfe. From there we return along the same path to the Altbach S-Bahn station we came in on.",

Orientation is usually not difficult in the clearly structured terrain. As this tour is best undertaken in good firn conditions, it is definitely recommended to bring crampons, and under certain circumstances even crampons and ice axes can be helpful.",

            "description_long": "The Schneck is a very striking Allgäu mountain with partly extremely steep grassy slopes, white in winter, which can be seen well from the Oytal valley. If you want to climb it on skis, you need to be in good shape (long valley ascent through the Oytal) and have good orientation skills. The slopes of the ascent and descent route have north-, west- and south-facing alignments of different inclinations. In some places we have to be prepared for quite steep passages. The connecting ridge from the fore summit to the main summit can only be mastered on foot in extremely exposed climbing of difficulty grade I-II (UIAA). This last section is reserved for very experienced alpinists, as the ridge is often impassable, especially in icy conditions and cornices. But even without the main summit, which is only 10 m higher, this ski tour remains very rewarding, as the views of the wintry Allgäu mountains are breathtaking. The <a href=\"http://www.oytalhaus.de/\">Oytalhaus </a><p>is a cosy place to stop for refreshments with good cuisine along the way.</p>",

During the Christmas and carnival holidays, a toboggan taxi also runs from Langenschwand up to the alp. However, the hike up is highly recommended due to the beautiful view.

            "description_long": "The Risserkogel is a good ski tour, especially in February or March. On the one hand, there is enough snow to protect the existing forest, and on the other hand, there may be a little firn, as some of the slopes are quite steep, which is why a safe ascent technique is necessary. You also need to be in good shape, as you have to overcome a difference in altitude of a good 1000 metres. The ascent and descent route runs largely on south to south-west facing slopes, which are often unstable due to their steepness after fresh snowfall. The slope orientation promises safe conditions soon after bad weather, but the tour is most fun in good firn. The orientation is not easy due to the lack of ascent tracks in the wooded and unclear terrain. Those unfamiliar with the area should avoid this tour in fog, as the narrow connecting ridge between Grubereck and Risserkogel has steep rocky slopes. In addition, dangers can lurk due to snow cornices.\r\n<p> </p>",

The baroque church of St. Laurentius is worth a look. At the last houses of Dittwar, we change to a field path to our right, which we follow for a while. We pass vineyards, of which the \"Dittwarer Oelkuchen\" vineyard enjoys a particularly good reputation. At a fork in the road near a group of trees, we take the right-hand path, then turn left and right again at the next four-way intersection and walk along the edge of the forest for a while. Follow the second forest path on the right through the \"Bischofsheimer Gründle\". Again we come across the B27, cross it and after a few metres enter the forest again on the left. Cross the Stammberg and continue through fields and meadows to Tauberbischofsheim. The Stammbergweg, which we are now on, joins Königheimer Straße shortly before a roundabout. Straight ahead at the roundabout, we reach the Glockengraben again via the main road, which takes us back to our starting point at the station.

Instead of following the road to the right, we choose a small shortcut diagonally right through the forest. This brings us to the road \"Nach dem Stadion\", which runs between the Haselbrunn open-air swimming pool and the Vogtland Stadium. Behind the sports facilities, our path leads to the left, following route \"J6\", through the beautiful Plauen city forest with nature trail. We pass a refuge and arrive in Jößnitz. There we first turn right into Beethovenstraße and then via Musikantenweg into Gluckstraße, which we follow to the right into Richard-Wagner-Straße. Here we turn left into Wilhelm-Külz-Straße, which takes us to Rohrweg. There we have a great view of our next destination, Jößnitz Castle, which is perched on a rocky spur high above the town. The ascent via Bahnhofstraße and Schloßstraße is rewarded with a magnificent view. From here we can overlook large parts of the Vogtland. Our path now changes to the route marked \"J8\" and leads along Fabrikstraße and Röttiser Straße in the direction of Lohbachschlucht. Shortly before the first houses of Dobra, we turn left and walk along above the Lohbach stream until we meet the Döhlaubach stream, which we follow down to the Barthmühle mill. With our next destination - the imposing Elstertal bridge - already in sight, we cross the river Weiße Elster here. Over a footbridge along the railway line we come into the Triebtal, the core area of \"Vogtland Switzerland\". We follow the course of the Trieb against the direction of flow and after about two kilometres we reach the dam wall of the Pöhl dam. If you like, you can make a detour to the \"Mosenturm\" (mosque tower) on the Eisenberg and take another look over the dam to the Oberland. However, we always follow the route \"J8\" to the boat landing stage and further along the dam. At the edge of the forest, we turn right and then left again, moving away from the shore of the reservoir. Near the sewage treatment plant we meet the road to Möschwitz, but immediately leave it again to the right in the direction of Lochhaus. Along a meadow path with resting places we come to the \"Lochbauer\", an old Vogtland three-sided farmstead. This historical monument is now an inn where we can fortify ourselves for the way back.

From here we enjoy wonderful views of the valley and the surrounding mountain ranges. A beautiful single trail through the forest makes you forget the efforts of the ascent in no time.",
            "description_long": "We start our mountain bike tour at Marienplatz in the centre of Immenstadt. At the ice cream parlour we keep to the right, pass through an archway into the monastery garden and cross it. We then cross the Jahnstrasse and follow the Gröntenstrasse straight on, rounding the school building on the right at its end. Behind it we meet a narrow asphalted footpath, which we follow to the left, pass under the tracks a few metres later, briefly follow the Allgäuer Strasse and then keep to the left. On a narrow cycle and hiking path we pass the sports field, then cross the Iller and an asphalt road and keep left at the next junction. On the shore of the Auwaldsee we reach the outskirts of Rauhenzell. There we cross a short meadow and then reach the Weidachweg. Continue slightly uphill until you reach Buchwaldstrasse, which brings you to the centre of Rauhenzell. Here we turn left at Rettenbergstrasse and cross the main road shortly afterwards. At the next crossroads, turn left and follow the Rauhenzell road to the right of the car park for hikers across the fields to the village of Hauhenzell, which you leave again immediately via the village road. Shortly after the village, keep left at the fork in the road and you will reach the village of Burgberg. Turn left into Blaichacher Stra&szlig, then turn right at Sonthofener Stra&szlig and follow Jägerweg on your left into Edelwei&szligstra&szlig, leaving Burgberg behind you. In the next right-hand bend, turn right, cross the Starzlach and follow the dirt road to Winklerstrasse. Shortly before entering Sonthofen, the Salzweg begins on the left-hand side, which leads us to the village of Berghofen. There we turn right into Schellenbergstra&szlig, which in turn leads into Waltenerstra&szlig. Follow this road uphill until you reach Steig. Now we take the asphalted road to Unterried. After Unterried, follow the bend to the right and cycle steadily uphill on the main path through woods and meadows towards Blassleskopf. In between we can enjoy great views of the surrounding mountain and foothill landscape. After a while we leave a car park on the left, pass a barrier and continue on the main asphalted path until we reach a turning point. Here we have reached our destination. After a break, we continue downhill on our approach path until we turn right at a crossroads and enter the forest. We follow the beautiful forest trail steeply downhill. This flowing single trail offers enormous riding fun and requires technical skills. It goes on soft, unblocked forest soil and partly over roots through dense forest. After about 1 km, above Unterried, we meet the asphalt road again, on which we roll down to Unterried. From here we go uphill again for a short distance. About 500 m further on, a gravel path branches off to our left, which we follow downhill through the forest. After a short stretch in the meadow, we reach a cattle fence shortly before Berghofen. After overcoming this, we return to Immenstadt on asphalted roads on the plain. From Berghofen we now take the Salzweg to Winklerstrasse, which we turn left onto, then keep right at the next junction and cycle straight on to the Ostrach. At the bridge we change direction to the right and turn left about 120 m later. Now we follow a meadow path to Ortwang. After Ortwang we turn west, cross the Iller and in Blaichach follow the cycle path along the river in a north-westerly direction to Immenstadt. After a while we come to a roundabout and leave it at the third exit to cross under the railway tracks. Behind it we continue on Liststraße parallel to the railway line until we reach Mummener Straße. There we turn right, cross Sonthofener Stra&szlig, which we follow briefly to the left and then continue along Salzstra&szlig via Kirchplatz to Marienplatz, our starting point.",

On the shady \"Path of Love\" many resting benches with engraved poems on the theme of love invite you to rest and reflect.

            "description_long": "We start our hike through the animal enclosure at the meeting point at car park P1, near the Globus. The hike through the open area brings us close to around 30 of the original inhabitants of the Bavarian Forest National Park: bison, wolf or brown bear have been extinct in the region for over 100 years. Early morning and late afternoon are usually good for observing the animals. Due to the extensive landscape enclosures, it is also advisable to bring binoculars. At the end of the hike, we should definitely climb up to the Hans Eisenmann House. This is where the approximately 1 km long circular trail to the plant enclosure begins.",

However, it is also a challenge for adults, because the most difficult part of the route is C/D! The boulders over which the trail was built are exposed on the east side of the wooded ridge of the Sattelberg above Ramsau am Dachstein. The descent leads along a nature and environmental adventure trail that has also been set up especially for children. Orientation is easy as the trail is excellently signposted and so is the nature trail. The Sattelberghütte is a refreshment stop directly on the trail. The old flour mill near the entrance can be visited every Friday. <br/>",

It is worth climbing in between the rocks to take in their impressive dimensions of several metres in height.

            "description_long": "From the Kurhaus in Oy, we cycle down between the football pitches in the direction of \"Mühlbachweg/Faistenoy\" along the idyllic stream. In Faistenoy, at the level of the Hensel guesthouse, we turn right onto the road \"Am Wiesenrain\" and after 200 m cycle right uphill on the gravel path. At an asphalt road, we continue straight ahead until we reach the next fork, where we turn right through the gate. We leave the hut on the right and cycle downhill on the gravel road on the left at the signpost. At the next junction we keep to the right and after about 50 m we turn left on the footpath downhill in the direction of \"Mittelberg\". On the Ellegghöhe we cycle down a short trail over the steps, then we turn right and cycle immediately left again uphill on the asphalt path to the bridge. After the bridge, we turn left onto a gravel path in the direction of \"Horn/Petersthal\". At the end of the path, cycle right along the fence uphill to the gate. We leave a bench on the right and roll downhill again on a gravel path to the left. At first we keep straight on until we reach the asphalt road, then we cycle downhill to the right into the village of Burgkranzegg. At the \"Augustin Riedmüller\" farm, we turn off onto an asphalt path. Soon we reach a hut, where we turn right and after about 50 m we cycle right uphill again. At the fork near the bench, we now turn right onto the meadow path in the direction of \"Wertach\". We cross the forest and pass a barn until we reach a triangle of paths that we already know from the journey here. We turn left uphill in the direction of \"Faistenoy\" and turn left again at the next junction. After about 150 m, we turn right, at the edge of the forest we change through the gate onto the smaller forest path, which continues in the same direction. We ignore the fork, come to a small hut and continue straight ahead here on the gravel path in the direction of \"Mittelberg\". Now we follow the high trail to the beginning of the asphalt. At the crossroads (with bench) we cycle left onto the concrete path, then ride on a narrow meadow path along the fence, which leads into a \"hollow alley\" reminiscent of the story of William Tell. At the next triangle of paths, we cycle left to a large larch and here we roll left downhill again towards \"Oberzollhaus\". Behind the gate, we turn left and immediately right again through the hollow way to Haag. In the village, we first cycle to the right and immediately turn left again and cycle past the Haag country inn to the end of the asphalt road. Here we cycle left on the gravel path in the direction of \"Oberzollhaus\" until we turn right at the road junction and cross the subway. Now we come to a large crossroads where we turn left, pass Oberzollhaus and turn right at the recycling island towards \"Kreuzbänkle\". At the following fork, turn right uphill to a single farm. At the fork shortly after the farm, cycle right in the direction of \"Kreuzbänkle\". Ignore the next left turn and turn left at the next junction. The sign \"Kreuzbänkle\" is hidden in the bushes. We leave the Kreuzbänkle behind us and follow the path in several bends down to the gravel path at the Schwarzenberger Weiher. A meadow trail leads directly down to the kiosk. Here you can take a break for a swim or a cappuccino. We now cycle past the kiosk, turn left at the barrier onto the car park until we reach the connecting road Oy-Oberzollhaus. Now we cycle first to the left, at the next junction to the right through the subway. After another subway, we turn left until after about 200 m we turn right onto a meadow path. We continue until we reach the forest and there we branch off to the left and cycle uphill always along the stream. On this last gorge path we reach Kressen, where we take the road towards \"Oy\" and reach our starting point.",

            "description_long": "On this hike we pass many historical sites that bear witness to the settlement and industrial history of the region:<p> </p><p>The rocky peak of the Lärchenbühl is, like the Thierstein castle hill, an extinct volcanic vent. Its basalt columns were probably removed to build the castle in Thierstein. Since Thierstein Castle was already so dilapidated at the end of the 16th century that repairs seemed too costly, the margravial government in Bayreuth decided to build a new official building. In 1602, the official building still called \"Schlößlein\" was built (today privately owned).</p><p>In Leupoldshammer or Neuenhammer, there had been a stately armoury in the Margrave's time (around 1800). Today, the power station is located at this site, which was put into operation in 1935. In Blumenthal, water power was used early on. In the mid-18th century there was an iron cutting mill here which was later converted into a saw and grist mill. At the end of the 19th century, the porcelain factory owner Hutschenreuther bought Blumenthal, built a villa and had numerous ponds constructed for fish farming. A holiday farm was created in the buildings of the estate for employees and jubilarians seeking recreation.</p><p>Hafendeck, one of the oldest mills in the region (end of the 15th century, also known as the Thierstein mill), once belonged to the Thierstein clay industry (quartz mill). When there were no more potters, it was converted into a grinding mill. Pfannenstiel was once the home of pitch scrapers, tar burners, pitch and grease boilers. A large, flat stone in the forest, popularly called the Devil's Table, is the base plate of a lubricating furnace. Here, grease was extracted from pine wood and tree pitch, which was needed by the hammer mills and carters. During the heyday of iron smelting in the Eger valley, ore and charcoal transports from the Arzberg ore mine and from the Reich and coal forests also rolled along the important trade route that led from Magdeburg to Regensburg. That is why the much-travelled road used to be called \"Eysenstras\".</p>",

Starting from the cemetery, the road climbs very steeply and leads us into the idyllic Steigbach valley. On a well-maintained forest road, follow the signs to \"Naturfreundehaus/Gschwenderhorn\". At the height of Alpe Seifenmoos, the base of the lmmenstadt mountain rescue team, the forest thins out and gives us a clear view of the mountains of the Nagelfluhkette. At the Naturfreundehaus, a large fleet of mountain bikes usually signals that this is a popular stop for cyclists from the surrounding area. <br/>From the Naturfreundehaus, the trail now leads us in the direction of „Gschwenderhorn\". A detour to the summit „costs\" us only fünf minutes. On the wide gravel road we finally follow the signs to the „Starkatsgund-Alpe\". From this alpine pasture, we do not cycle down into the valley on the road, but stay on the hill west of the mountain inn „Bärenfalle“ and cycle to the mountain station of the Ratholzer chairlift „Alpsee-Skizirkus“. Below the lift line we cycle through serpentines down to the car park. On the other side of the main road we continue through the reeds and marshes of the Konstanzer Ach to the railway line and from there to the right along the Gro&szlig Alpsee to Bühl am Alpsee.

At the next opportunity, we leave the road to the right onto a field path. The area around Külsheim is known for its abundance of orchids. If you look closely, you can discover the exotic-looking plants, which are also native here in Germany, in this intact natural landscape. We take the second path to the left, two crossroads later the path to the right, then again the second path to the left and thus reach the edge of a forest through the fields. There we follow the path into the forest and come to a T-junction, where we take the left option. After a bend to the right, we continue straight ahead for a while, then we reach a four-way intersection, where we take the left option. Behind a field we walk along the opposite edge of the forest on the left, but soon leave it behind us. At the third junction, we turn right, again towards the forest. In the shade of the trees, we follow the path and come across the country road from Külsheim to Tauberbischofsheim. After crossing the road, we turn left parallel to the road for a short distance before turning right into the field at the third opportunity and walking straight ahead. After a while, we pass a piece of forest again. Where the edge of the forest leaves our path, we take the next turn to the left and walk towards the forest. At the first trees, we take the right path, which first leads us along the edge of the forest, then into the forest. There we turn right at the next opportunity and walk straight on until we reach a T-junction. There we turn left and continue straight ahead through the forest. At the second four-way intersection, we orient ourselves to the left, turn right at the next T-junction and come to a fork in the path, where we keep left. On this path we finally leave the wooded area and come back to Külsheim passing the sports field on the left. We come across the country road that we have already crossed elsewhere, follow it for a short distance and then turn right into Wolferstetter Weg. From there we turn right into Haagstraße, then diagonally left along Römerbadweg and via the main road and Uissigheimer Straße back to Kirchbergweg, which takes us back to our starting point at Külsheim Castle. We can stop for a bite to eat in the picturesque old town of Külsheim at the end of the walk.",

The nature and culture trail is intended to provide an overview of the history, landscape and nature of the Tauber valley. With a beautiful view of the Königshöfer Turmberg, we walk a short distance along the hill. We do not follow our path, which now describes a right-hand bend, any further, but hike straight ahead on a grassy path. Along the path we find interesting descriptions of the nesting boxes placed there. At the first of a total of ten stations on the nature trail, we have a wonderful view of Königshofen and Marbach. \r<br/>We follow this path downhill until we reach the chapel, turn right there into a narrow path and reach the road to Lauda via a steep staircase. Instead of following this, we take a sharp right directly onto the \"Roter Weg\" and pass a beehive standing on the side of the path to our right. A short climb follows along beautiful dry stone walls, at the end of which we can look back at Unterbalbach, Königshofen and the Turmberg. After a short distance, we see a vineyard and the Umpfertal valley with the village of Sachsenflur. We descend a wooden staircase to the left to a narrow path, which we follow with a view of Beckstein. Another flight of stairs brings us steeply down to just before the wine road that leads to Beckstein. Here we turn right, hike past the quarry uphill again and come back through the vineyards to Königshofer Weg and our starting point at the street corner.",

            "description_long": "Our starting point is the railway station of the state-recognised resort town of Jocketa, whose charming townscape is characterised by 19th century villas. From here we walk along the tracks to Bergstraße and down to the left to Barthmühle. With the imposing Elster Valley Bridge in view, we cross a footbridge along the railway line into the Trieb Valley, the core area of \"Vogtland Switzerland\". Upstream, we now follow the course of the Trieb and after about two kilometres we reach the dam wall of the Pöhl dam.  <br/>The dam bears its name in memory of the former village of Pöhl, which had to give way to the waters when the dam was built in the 1960s. The foundation walls of some of the houses are still partly preserved today, but are mostly far below the water surface. At low tide, however, they can occasionally be seen jutting out of the water. With the reform of the municipalities in Saxony, the name Pöhl was given a new lease of life: the formerly independent districts around the northern part of the Pöhl dam are now grouped together under this name. The dam, once built as a service water reservoir for central German industry, today fulfils the function of flood protection and recreation centre. <br/>From here, our path always leads along the dam wall, past the boat landing stage and the natural outdoor pool to the tourist information office at the Gunzenberg campsite. We walk past the lake ponds, cross a path and come across the road to Möschwitz, which we follow a little way to the left. The beach path to Voigtsgrüner Bucht branches off to our left and takes us closer to the shore again. On the beach path we pass the bungalow settlement Voigtsgrün and come to the edge of Altensalz. We walk through the village of Altensalz on the village road and cross under the A72 motorway. Immediately behind the motorway, we turn left onto a small path and then right over the two barriers of Neuensalz and Thoßfell to the north bank of the dam. If you want to fortify yourself for the way back, the Küpfers Restauration on the main road of Thoßfell is just the right place. Our path goes past the left edge of Thoßfell, under the A72 and along the village road to Gansgrün. We walk through Gansgrün and straight on, passing a rest area on the western slope of the Rollhübel, until we meet the shoreline of the reservoir again. To get to the next village, Helmsgrün, we turn right here, turn left twice and go right again at the second opportunity. In Helmsgrün, a forest village on the Bellwitzbach stream, we keep to the left and follow the course of the bank for a while. Then, passing the sailors' campsite and the youth hostel, we cross the castle peninsula and reach Rodlera on the Aubach. The name Schlosshalbinsel (castle peninsula) is a reminder of the former Pöhl Castle, which had to be blown up during the construction of the dam. Our path leads, always following the shoreline, past the bungalow settlements of Rodlera and Neudörfel and a caravan settlement, until we reach the dam centre with a drive-in cinema, sports garden and restaurant. From the main road we are currently on, Pöhler Straße branches off to the right shortly before the dam wall. Follow it through Alt Jocketa to Jocketa and return to our starting point at the station via Dorfstraße and along the railway tracks.",

            "description_long": "If we start at the former station building, we first cross Waldkirchen's main road at the railway crossing. This is where the Adalbert Stifter cycle path begins. It runs along a disused railway line that once led to Haidmühle and into what is now the Czech Republic. The cycle path on the former track is wide and comfortable to cycle on, as we are spared steep climbs. At the same time, this route opens up the most beautiful spots of this landscape. Right at the beginning we have wonderful views of Waldkirchen. At a beautiful rest stop after about 2 km, information boards tell us about the history of the railway line. The line has been completely closed since 1976 and the tracks have been dismantled. Today, the route is used as a cycling and hiking route in summer and as a cross-country ski trail in winter. The rest of the route to Erzlauwiesel delights us with numerous fantastic views. At the rather busy main road from Erzlauwiesel to Reichermühle, we can take a nice detour to the Erzlauzwiesel reservoir. To do this, we leave the former railway line to the right, ride on the cycle path east of the road over the newly built motorway and behind it to the left on an unpaved path about 300 m parallel to it. Then we follow the signs to the right, slightly downhill. After 300 m we meet a little-used asphalt side road, follow it to the right for about 80 m in the direction of Erzlauzwiesel, but then turn left on a beautiful path into the spa park, which leads us to the Erzlauwiesel sunbathing lawn. We circle the reservoir on a quiet path. On the south shore, benches invite you to linger. Opposite the café/restaurant Schröckseis we reach the road again. We return to the Adalbert Stifter cycle path on the same route uphill. We continue cycling along its route in a north-easterly direction - as far as Jandelbrunn. There we can take a detour up into the village. In front of the former station building, the station road leads uphill to the main street. Here several restaurants invite you to take a break. After 100 m on the left side of the main road we reach the historic building of the private brewery Josef Lang. To continue, we return to the station and go back for about 200 m to the subway. Behind it, a path branches off to the right and takes us up to the road. We ride on the little-used road for a few kilometres slightly uphill past Schlag until we emerge from the forest and reach the connecting road to Altreichenau. We turn left and soon reach Hintereben. Once again we are thrilled by the wide views over the mountains of the Bavarian Forest. At the church in Hintereben, we stay left on the Poppenreuther Weg to Edhäusel. When you reach the second village, Poppenreuth, look out after 300 m for the turn-off on the right to Neufang and Stadl. In front of a magnificent scenic backdrop, the descent continues at breakneck speed to Neufang. In the village we turn right and continue to Stadl. Up to Stadl we have to pedal hard again. 100 m after the centre of Auerbach, the asphalt road leads us downhill to the connecting road from Waldkirchen to Freyung. We follow the road to the right for 200 m only. Then we see a service road on the sharp left and ride through the street village of Mayersäge. On the road we now head slightly uphill towards the south. When we have passed under the railway line to Freyung, we turn right onto the road to Waldkirchen. Before the railway crossing, the restaurant \"Zum Bacherlwirt\" invites you to stop for a break. This takes us to our starting point.",

            "description_long": "From the Frauenstein hikers' car park, we hike uphill, following the \"red H on a white background\" marking and the path to Frauenstein. The \"red H\" accompanies us throughout the Haubentour. The cube-shaped Frauenstein (1) on a hilltop crowns a prehistoric burial site. The top of the dolomite block is shaped like a basin and, according to tradition, served as a baptismal font for St. Kilian during his missionary work in Franconia. Behind the stone, we keep to the right and turn right again onto the forest path. We pass the mountain station of a ski lift - with a beautiful view of the northern Rhön. Soon a wonderful meadow path leads between fields, the \"Breiten First\" (2), until we reach the road at Sparhöfe. We do not hike into the village, but, with a wonderful distant view, uphill to the left. After 150 m, we turn right onto the forest path. The path leads up and down through high spruce and beech forest. We pass a large clearing. Afterwards, the path leads in a large curve out into the fields. In front of us we can see the houses of Heubach. But we turn right and pass an old oak tree, under which a bench invites us to take a rest. The path continues uphill towards a transmission mast. The gravel path bends to the right, then to the left and crosses the road to the Steiger car park. There we find a shelter. Choosing the forks to the right, we pass the crest with the transmission mast and continue walking uphill. In a left-hand bend there is another bench (3) with a view over the hilly landscape to Heubach. Then walk briefly along the edge of the forest and turn right into the forest. Turn right above the motorway and walk downhill to a bridge. Here we cross the motorway and continue straight ahead until the forest path makes a tight left turn. Here we turn right onto the grassy path that runs through a clearing and between larks, pines and firs. In summer, the poisonous but beautiful foxglove blooms here. Now a soft, narrow path runs through young forest. The romantic path runs along the old border between the Kingdom of Bavaria and Prussia, today's state border between Bavaria and Hesse. We find the Nassau lion on the old boundary stones (4) from 1729. If we follow this border straight on over the Kleine Haube, we reach the observation tower of the Große Haube (5) after a steeper climb. The new tower from 2005 is built of steel and wood. From its 23.8 m height and the eleven intermediate platforms, you can look out over the Rhön as far as the Taunus and Spessart. A shelter is built into the tower, but there is also a seating area for a rest. Finally, we follow the border for a short distance until a forest path leads us steeply downhill to the left. We come across a forest path, which we follow until we reach a crossroads with an old oak tree, the Jägereiche (6), with a seating area. Turn left and walk through the forest until you reach a road after about 2 km. Here we go downhill to the right, past a refuge and to a motorway subway. On the other side, we walk to the right, parallel to the motorway, until the \"red H\" shows us the way to the left across the fields. It goes downhill, we cross the stream \"Schmidtwasser\" and get past fruit trees to the Fuldaer Straße. The shortest way back to the car park would be to turn left on the road through Heubach. However, we prefer the path that branches off to the right again after 100 m and leads us to the edge of the forest. We pass a cosy, covered resting place for hikers. The hike continues across the fields, past the sports field, and towards the elevation of the Frauenstein. The last stretch of road leads up to the barbecue area and the Frauenstein car park.",

            "description_long": "Our starting point is the chapel at the village square in Grünbach. We follow the village road past the playground in the direction of Abtschlag. Shortly after a left-hand bend, our hiking trail branches off to the right. The hike is very well marked throughout as a circular trail \"11\". The route leads through a small wood and across fields up to Abtschlag. At the first house we turn left, walk to the road in the village and follow it to the left. At the village exit sign, we turn right onto the gravel path. In the forest, we cross a stream and shortly afterwards turn left at the fork. The path leads steadily downhill in a large curve and becomes a meadow path shortly after a turning area. Here we take a rooty path to the left down into the valley of the Gernbach stream. We finally turn right and walk on a slightly ascending forest path parallel to the stream. We come across a road, turn left and immediately turn left again onto the road to Innernzell. We follow this road for only about 75 m before we turn right and walk parallel to the Bernecker Bach stream. At the first fork, we keep left and the path leads us quite steeply out of the valley until we reach the edge of the forest. A field path with a beautiful view of the Gernbach valley and the Bavarian Forest takes us up to \"Ort\". At the chapel, we turn left and walk through the hamlet to the road that branches off to Innernzell. Walk along this road past the red deer enclosure to the edge of the forest. Here we change to the forest road to the left. Turn left at a fork in the road. We follow a meadow path across fields, here we have a beautiful view back to \"Ort\". Finally, we re-enter the forest and walk to the right in the direction of Lungdorf. We walk through the village with pretty houses and a small wooden chapel with a cosy resting place. At the end of the village, we turn left onto the gravel path with paved lanes and hike straight down through a wet meadow area. Just before we reach the Gernbach stream, we follow the markings to the right. Now we continue downhill along the stream until the path seems to end in front of a river. A little to the right of this point we can cross the wide part of the Mitternacher Ohe on a wooden footbridge. But maybe we just want to linger a while at this enchanted place, watch the water and admire the purple-blue aconite growing here. On the other side, the path leads uphill and turns into an asphalt road. At the road junction before Kleinarmschlag, we keep left and follow the road down through the forest. After about 600 m, the signs point us to the left onto a gravel path to the former mill. We cross a bridge and arrive at the old stone-built building. Here we find another pretty wooden footbridge, over which we walk to the other side of the stream and follow the signs to Grünbach. A narrow path leads steeply uphill through the spruce forest. At a junction, we continue uphill and soon reach the edge of the forest. Then we go through the forest for a bit, we step out of the forest and walk to the right on a field path back to Grünbach. In the distance we see Kirchdorf in the forest. We reach Grünbach and can admire some beautiful horses of the Haflinger breed. Then we pass the large, neat farms with the typical round gates and come back to the chapel. There is a hermitage on the outskirts of the village where we can end the hike in comfort.",

The grain elevator, the market hall for grain, has always played an important role for the town. Around 1350 it was even the second largest in Bavaria after that of Munich. It is therefore not surprising that Erding is also the location of a well-known brewery. However, the abundance of grain could not protect the town from the ravages of war. In 1632, for example, the Swedes invaded Erding during the Thirty Years' War. The town has very beautiful old buildings that are well worth seeing. These include parts of the old town fortifications, for example the Landshuter Tor with its \"beautiful tower\" at the east end of Schrannenplatz. The church of St. Johann is also well worth a visit.",

We leave the Sonthofener Hof behind us and continue towards Sonthofener Hörnle, where the gravel path ends below the summit. Shortly before, we turn right onto a trail that leads us in a curve below the summit to the Altstädter Hof. After a snack, it is worth making a detour in the direction of Gehrenkopf. The strenuous ascent is rewarded with a panoramic view and - with a bit of luck - a magnificent sunset. We roll back along the same path to Altstädter Hof and start the exciting descent into the Illertal. On the winding asphalt road in the direction of \"Altstädten\", we branch off to the right in the wooded area onto a trail that joins a road on the outskirts of Altstädten.

            "description_long": "Our tour starts at the car park at the spa gardens in Bad Staffelstein. We orientate ourselves on the road towards the north and cross under the railway line at the platform subway before keeping left at the station. On the opposite side of the road, we use the pavement to continue walking north. We cross the bypass on a bridge and reach Schönbrunn on the footpath and cycle path, which we walk through in a northerly direction. Shortly after entering the town, we turn left off the footpath and cycle path and walk beautifully along Schönbrunner See, a quarry pond, before we reach the adjacent Reundorfer See. Here we also find a bathing opportunity that is popular in summer. Now we keep to the left and cross the Main at the weir. The town of Coburg has been generating electricity here for over 100 years. In Hausen we keep to the right for a short while before we hike steeply uphill through the forest to Banz. The steep section demands a lot of us, but we are rewarded with a stop at the monastery restaurant - or with the magnificent view from the church steps. Today, the monastery serves as a conference centre for the Hanns Seidl Foundation, which has close ties to the CSU. The Banz monastery library was world-famous before secularisation. The spacious inner courtyard of the monastery is also impressive - or the museum with treasures from Duke Max of Bavaria.\n<br/>Finally, we make our way back to Bad Staffelstein and walk along the road on the footpath through Neubanz, always steeply downhill to Unnersdorf, where the \"Berggasthof Banzer Wald\" invites us to stop for a break on the wonderful open-air terrace with a view of Banz. In Unnersdorf, we first turn left and then walk straight ahead until we cross the Main bridge before turning right at the sign \"AquaRiese\". At the adventure pool we have the opportunity to stop for a break or to take a dip in the indoor pool or the adjacent outdoor pool. We return to our starting point in a few minutes through the nearby spa park, but should not miss the opportunity to take a rest in the impressive graduation house. At the end of the tour, we can also relax in the Obermain Therme.",

We cross this and follow the white-green marked circular trail number 6 on the other side. In Steinkart we come across an asphalt road and turn left into it. We pass Geisberg am Wald and turn left behind the village towards Dobl. At the fork in the road behind the small chapel at Dobl, we keep to the right and hike through the forest to Adlmörting. Here we walk a few metres along the asphalt road, but then turn left again onto a field path. This leads us into the forest again. After a long left-hand bend, we finally turn right onto a small path. This takes us past the Hohlen Stein (1) - a Stone Age dwelling cave, as evidenced by numerous finds of shards and tools. Soon we reach a wider forest path again, onto which we turn left. At the next fork in the road, we keep to the right. We always follow the forest road straight ahead, but then turn right again shortly before the through road. We now descend into the \"Schärengräben\" and from there up again to a wide forest road, where we turn right. At the next fork we keep left again and hike straight ahead for almost 2 km. Finally, however, we turn sharply left and walk down to the through road. Cross the road and turn right onto the gravel path on the other side. At Lindenweg, turn left to the main road and turn left again to reach the monastery church of St. Salvator (2). From here we walk back to the crossroads. There we turn right into Luisenburgstraße. We walk straight ahead and finally enter the forest again. We now keep climbing uphill and turn left uphill at the fork in the road. At the small clearing, we keep to the right, following the white-green signpost to the cult stone (3). From there it is only a few metres until you reach a wide forest path again. Continue along this path to the right. Shortly afterwards, however, we take another sharp turn to the left. This is how we reach the Luisenburg (4). This is a bizarre formation of quartz conglomerates - a sedimentary rock. The site once served the Celts as a place of worship and sacrifice. We finally come across a forest road again and turn into it to the right. At the wide forest road, we keep left, but turn right again shortly before the through road. At the next fork, we continue to the left, turn right at the forest kindergarten and reach the \"Steinernen Schwammerl\" (5) - a rock formation that resembles a mushroom. From here, the trail continues downhill. In the right-hand bend, we turn left. At a wide forest path we keep left and shortly afterwards right again. We now walk straight ahead until we reach a crossroads. There we have the possibility to take a shortcut. To do so, we would have to follow the white-green marking \"A6\" to the left. Otherwise, we turn sharply right at this point and come to the golf course (6). There we continue to the left up through the Schwarzholz. At the edge of the forest, keep left and walk along it for a while before turning into the Schwarzholz again. Always following the markings, we then return to our starting point after a few minutes.",

            "description_long": "From the car park of Miltach Castle, we follow the Perlbach stream to a subway, then cycle right uphill and finally right again to Zandt. There we recognise the small castle in the middle of the village on the left side. Today it is used as an old people's home, but a detour into the castle courtyard with a free-standing chestnut tree is worthwhile and also permitted. We now cycle on in the direction of Schachendorf and arrive at Schönferchen with the pilgrimage church Maria Schnee. Behind the village we turn left in the direction of Gutmaning. There is also a small castle on a slope, but it is privately owned and can only be visited from the outside. We continue up the slope and through the fields to Hof. Then we cycle on to Chammünster. Here we visit another highlight of our circular route. The parish church of the Assumption of Mary, dating from 739, is Romanesque on the outside, but on the inside it was extended in the 11th century in early Gothic style, which we can see from the ribbed vaults and the slightly pointed arches. A few centuries later, a High Baroque altar was added. In front of the church are several wrought-iron crosses that are worth a look. At the end of the village in the direction of Chamerau, we can take a break at the \"Ödenturm\" inn. We now cycle along the main road on a well-maintained cycle path. In Schlondorf we cycle through the village and past some fields. Then we meet the main road again and cycle along the cycle path to Chamerau. At the signpost at the entrance to the village we already recognise the church with its onion tower and arrive at the Regen bridge. On the bridge we enjoy the view over the river and also see an old water wheel. After rolling down the bridge and over the railway tracks, we turn left onto Kötztinger Straße and cycle slightly uphill towards Roßbach. Here we meet the side road and cycle up the hill towards Bad Kötzting. The road passes several sawmills until we turn right towards Bärndorf. We pass a meadow orchard and head directly towards the village. Behind Bärndorf, we continue uphill on the road until we come to a crossroads. We cross it and after a few metres we find a small rest area on the right-hand side on a forest path. The road now leads us downhill through the coniferous forest to Blaibach. At a fork, we first turn left towards the centre of the village. Then we follow the main road to the right. After about 200 m we reach the centre of the village. There you will find the rococo church of St. Elisabeth with its onion tower and stepped gable and Blaibach Castle on the other side of the road. We enter the castle courtyard through an archway and have a view of the main house, which has been converted into a restaurant. We return straight downhill through the centre of Blaibach, turn left over the railway tracks and cross the bridge over the Regen. This is where the district of Kreuzbach begins. At the first crossroads, turn right towards Miltach. At a road sign we find the marking \"Radwanderweg 14\". We follow the river on the cycle path until we enter the village of Miltach. Then we turn right and cycle through the village until we reach Miltach Castle, our starting point. At the end of our circular tour, we visit the approximately 400-year-old castle in Miltach. Here the owner runs a pottery.",

Accordingly, this ski tour is only recommended in really safe conditions. But then we look forward to an obstacle-free descent of almost 600 metres in altitude. The orientation of the slopes on which we move on the ascent and descent is northwest to northeast. Up to the Dalsenalm we move in mostly moderately steep terrain, where orientation is easy. Above the alp, the slopes become much steeper and good ascent and descent technique is required. Orientation above the mountain pasture also quickly becomes a challenge with poor visibility and missing tracks. We avoid the summit of the Weitlahnerkopf, which is not worth skiing anyway, for game protection reasons and end our tour at the Weitlahnerscharte (1670 m), from where we descend along our ascent route back to the starting point. We can have an après-tour café at Café Wasserfall near Hainbach on the connecting road between Aschau and Sachrang.\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

            "description_long": "We start our bike tour in Hofmarkstraße in Aicha vorm Wald at the level of the castle. From there we cycle towards the centre of the village. A little later we pass the sports field, leave Aicha vorm Wald and cycle a short distance along the Gaißa (1). Just before the bridge, however, we turn right in the direction of Bruck and then cycle under the through road. In Bruck we keep to the right immediately after entering the town, cross the Kleine Ohe and finally come to another through road at Mötzling. Turn left onto this road and then immediately right onto the field path. This brings us back to a through road, onto which we turn left. After about 150 m, keep to the right and you will reach Renholding. We cycle straight through the village and turn left behind the village exit in the direction of \"Renholding 34 - 38\". Past the \"Zur Blauen Traube\" inn, we now roll down the hill until we reach a crossroads. There we turn right. We cross the Bumperbach stream, pass under the road and finally reach Weferting. Here we turn left at the main road and thus pass the Pius and Leonhardi Church (2). From there we continue via Minsing down to Minsingermühle. From here, we now have a good start up to Klessing. There, after leaving the village, we turn right towards Ranzing and Haselbach (wooden signpost). We finally reach a through road again. We cross it, pass Ranzing and turn right at the bus stop towards Schnelling and Permeting. At the next fork in the road, we keep to the left, pass Permeting and shortly afterwards come down to the mill in Schnelling (3). From the lowest point of our tour, we now go up to the Höchsten: To do this, we keep left at the small chapel and ride via Boderding to Kirchberg vorm Wald (4). After a few metres, we have the opportunity to stop for a break at the \"Zum Kirchenwirt\" inn on the right. We continue along the road, through Epping and past Rettenberg up to Ebersberg - the highest point of our tour. From the nearby lookout tower (5) we can now enjoy the unique view of Passau Land. The path there branches off shortly after the \"Gasthaus Ebersberg\". Otherwise, we continue on the district road and soon keep to the right in the direction of Atzing and Windorf. Behind Atzing we cross the motorway bridge and cycle on to Walding. There we turn right towards \"Walding 7 - 12\". At Haitzing we again come to a fork in the road and keep to the right. This way we pass under the motorway again and finally pass Silling (6). At the end of the village we continue on the Katzensteinweg. At the fork in the road, keep to the right and shortly afterwards turn left again onto a dirt road. We cycle along the edge of the forest until we reach the Gaißa again. We cross the river for the last time and come back to Hofmarkstraße. There we turn right and cycle back to our starting point at Aicha vorm Wald Castle in a few minutes. This castle was first mentioned in documents under Bishop Adalbert of Passau (946 - 970). Today, the castle is privately owned by the ducal family of Croy, originally from France.",

            "description_long": "We turn left into Wisbacherstraße and at Petersplatz turn left into Salzburger Straße. There we follow the cycle path signs to the right into Haindlstraße. This becomes Lena-Christ-Straße, from which we turn right onto a field path following the cycle path signs. We cross the railway line at a level crossing and now cycle along the left bank of the Saalach. On the right side of the path we find an information sign about the bridge that stood here until 1899, the so-called Bichlbruck (1). The history of this connection goes back to the 10th century; already in 908 there was a crossing here by ship. The later bridge was especially important for the transport of salt from Berchtesgaden to Laufen. Time and again, the bridges at this location were destroyed by devastating floods. At low water we can still see remains of the old bridge piers in the river bed. We continue to Hammerau and at the entrance to the village follow the signs towards the new Hammerau Bridge (2). Cross the bridge to the Austrian side of the river. Now we cycle further downstream with beautiful views of the Salzach. At Gasthaus Schteg we cross the river again and turn right along the left bank. At the height of Freilassing, our path leaves the river bank. Shortly before the restaurant \"Zollhäusl\" (3), which invites us to take a break with its beautiful beer garden, we follow the signs to the right. When the path takes us back to the river bank, we see the imposing Rott hydroelectric power station (4). Commissioned in 2005, this plant generates 28 million kilowatt hours of electricity annually, supplying 8500 households. The power plant is a cross-border project. It is operated from Salzburg, but is located on Bavarian soil because the utilisation of hydropower can be optimised on the left side. The designers placed special emphasis on the ecological aspects. To preserve the species-rich fish population of the Saalach, a fishway was built to bypass the plant. We pass under the bridge at the power station and continue downstream. On a wooden bridge we pass the Mühlbach, which flows into the Saalach here. Soon the Saalach and the Salzach flow together and we now cycle along the Salzach. This is followed by a very beautiful, long section without buildings. Again and again, benches with a wonderful view of the river invite us to take a short break. Later we follow the signs to the left away from the river bank in the direction of \"Laufen Stadt\". We pass through a short stretch of forest and cross another mill stream over a wooden bridge. Then a causeway leads us to the right towards the forest and the banks of the Salzach. We now cycle along the bank and soon have the choice between a partly asphalted service road and a field path running parallel. Shortly before the large driving bridge over the Salzach, we cross an inflowing stream to the left over a wooden bridge and follow the cycle path signs to the left into the centre of the over 1250-year-old town of Laufen. Here we decide whether to cycle back to the starting point or take the train. As a variation option for the return journey by bike, we recommend switching to the Austrian side. To get to the station in Laufen, we cycle from the very worth seeing upper town gate (5), built around 1400, to the left into Tittmoninger Straße. Then we turn left into Teisendorfer Straße and follow this until we turn right to the railway station. We take the train back to Piding via Freilassing.",

            "description_long": "We start our bike tour in Krankenhausstraße at Vilshofen station. From here we now set off in an easterly direction. We follow the white-green signpost \"Tour de Baroque - Donauradweg\". We cycle past the hospital, cross the railway tracks and the Wolfach river and finally leave Vilshofen. Via Witzling we reach Hausbach and finally Hattenham. Soon we reach the Sandbacher Straße. We turn left into it - again following the white-green signs. A short time later we arrive in Sandbach. From here on, our cycle tour follows very unconventional paths for a short time: We turn left into the Förgengassl and cycle through it down to the ferry bridge on the Danube (1). There we ring the bell to call the ferryman. He then takes us across the water to the other side of the river. Here we cycle to the right along the Via Danubia (2) - an old Roman road. It runs the entire length from Bad Gögging via Regensburg, Straubing and Deggendorf to Passau. At the timber mill near Besensandberg, we cross the Stettinger Bach stream and shortly afterwards also the Deichselbergbach stream. We finally come across the through road and continue cycling on the cycle path to the right along the Donauleite. Soon we turn off the road again and now cycle to Gaishofen. There we pass the small chapel and then cycle on to Irring. From here our tour leads along the Danube again, on quiet paths under the huge motorway bridge (3). Shortly afterwards we reach the through road again. We continue, over the Gaißa and past Zieglstadl to the end of the cycle path. There we turn left towards Wörth and at the same time follow the white-green signpost \"Donauradweg\" again. Shortly after crossing the Wörther Bach stream, a cycle path and footpath begins again, on which we continue to Ranklhofweg. At this point we reach the other side of the road through a subway. There we continue cycling in the direction of Passau until we reach the Kachlet hydroelectric power station (4). On the bridge directly at the weir we now cross the Danube a second time. On the other side we turn left and after a few metres we reach the city of Passau (5). From the entrance to the town, however, we still have to cover a few kilometres to our destination, the main railway station: We first pass under the railway bridge and continue over the Hammerbach (6). At the asphalted road, we keep to the right and cross the thoroughfare at the traffic lights. On the other side we then continue on the cycle path in the direction of Passau. Behind the goods station, we turn right into Bahnhofstraße. After a few metres we reach our destination. From the main station we now have the opportunity to explore the city extensively - and there is always something worth seeing. After all, the three-river city lies at the confluence of the Danube, Inn and Ilz rivers. It is also a border town with Austria and a university and festival city. The Italian baroque cathedral houses the largest cathedral organ in the world. Also worth seeing are the Veste Oberhaus, the Salvator Church, the Niedernburg Monastery and numerous museums. In the Roman Museum, for example, the late antique wall remains of the former Boiotro fort are preserved. We also have the opportunity to take a short boat trip on the Danube from the nearby landing stage before finally returning to Vilshofen by train from Passau.",

The views of the Allgäu mountains below the impressive Höfats are second to none. The ascent to Höfats via the southeast ridge to the east summit is reserved for very experienced specialists. This is very difficult to secure in winter (UIAA II), extremely exposed, mostly icy and covered in cornices. The fact that we only ascend to the Älpelesattel does not detract from this tour, but we should still wait for stable conditions.",

            "description_long": "From the car park, we turn left into Freudensprungstraße and turn right into Bahnhofstraße. We leave this to the right into Postgartenweg. When this ends, we follow Lorenz-Zierl-Straße to the left and its course to the right, past the baroque parish church of the Assumption of Mary (built 1725-1727). Soon after, we turn left into Burgstraße and now walk through the core of the historic old town of Furth im Wald. We pass the old town hall on the right, whose historic walls date back to the 16th century and were probably the seat of civic self-government as early as 1332. On the left is the historic market square, the scene of the famous \"Drachenstich\", the oldest folk play in Germany. We continue straight ahead and pass the tourist information office uphill. On the right we see the town tower, built in 1866 to replace the keep of the medieval Pflegerschloss, which had been destroyed by a devastating town fire three years earlier. Directly adjacent to the town tower is the Furth im Wald Landestorm Museum, where you can also find the First German Dragon Museum. The monster used for the \"Drachenstich\" is stored in this house outside the play season. We continue straight ahead across the Schlossplatz and follow a pedestrian path at its end. This leads into Rosenstraße, which we follow to the left. Then we follow the signs \"Wanderweg F1\" in the direction of Dieberg to the right and get downhill onto a footpath. This leads into a road, which we follow to the right and shortly afterwards turn left in the direction of the open-air swimming pool. At the next fork in the road, we choose the right-hand option and continue straight ahead. We cross a bridge and pass the Chamb. Directly after the bridge, the open-air swimming pool on the right invites us to refresh ourselves in the warm months. The path leads into a road, which we follow briefly to the left and then leave at the first turn to the left. We walk past the Einberg campsite. Shortly afterwards, we find a very original rest area on the left side of the path with wooden seating and stone tables as well as a water pump. Directly opposite is the entrance to the wild garden. This beautifully arranged area offers a lot of interesting information about nature and is very vividly designed. The highlight of the garden is an underwater observation station at a pond. Here we can observe the fish living in the pond through large panes of glass, just like in a zoo aquarium. These include pike, roach, zander and perch. Shortly after the wildlife garden, we cross the Chamb on a very beautiful wooden bridge. Now we follow a path straight ahead that leads along the bank of a stream. Behind a crossing, it continues as a path and joins a road, which we follow to the right. We pass the level crossing and walk uphill towards the edge of the forest. There, at the school bus stop, we continue to the left and shortly afterwards follow the signs to the right into the forest. Soon the hiking trail \"F1\" branches off to the left in the direction of Dieberg onto the Herbert-Hartl-Steig. This leads us to the Dieberg hut of the Further mountain rescue service, in front of which a nice rest area invites us to take a break. We continue along the hiking trail \"F1\" in the direction of the Bayernwarte. This beautiful wooden lookout tower offers a magnificent view. It was built in 1974/75 by the Further mountain rescue service and is 20 m high. From the Bavarian Observatory we follow the hiking trail \"F1\" in the direction of Furth im Wald. It leads us beautifully through the forest down into the valley. We pass the Hackl Chapel and cross a railway tunnel. In the valley we come across the new \"Drachensee\". The reservoir, which serves as a flood retention basin for the Chamb, will be flooded from 2008. We walk back along the river and meet up with the outward route.",

            "description_long": "The car park at the mountain cemetery in Lauda is the starting point of our hike. On the asphalted Flürleinsweg we walk into the residential area of Ramstal, from where there is a beautiful view of the Oberlauda valley and the Altenberg vineyard, and cross it first on the Anne-Frank- and then on the Barbara-Brennfleck-Straße. The road turns into a grassy path on which we leave the village of Lauda. On the left on the slope is a baroque wayside shrine from around 1700, depicting the scene of the Mount of Olives. Our path leads upwards into the Ramstal-Hohlweg, at the end of which a bird sanctuary with a barbecue area invites you to take a rest. To the right of the wooden path, in the \"Eisberg\" biotope, protected plants and rare insects find a habitat between limestone banks, old vineyard walls and fruit trees. A few metres behind the barbecue hut, an asphalt path leads to the \"Galgensteige\", the highest point of our hike, where, flanked by chestnut trees, there is another wayside shrine. This one depicts Jesus carrying the cross. We turn left here onto a field path, which is also marked as the Main-Danube hiking trail. After an S-bend, we no longer follow the field path, but continue straight ahead on a grassy path leading downhill. Our route leaves the Main-Donau hiking trail a short time later and turns left into the forest path. On this path, we now walk briefly through the forest and always downhill towards Lauda. After leaving the forest, we have a beautiful view into the so-called Teilung Valley and of the \"Galgenberg\" natural monument to our left. Our view into the Middle Tauber Valley extends here from Königshofen with the Turmberg to the wine villages of Marbach, Gerlachsheim and Distelhausen. In the foreground we see the town scenery of Lauda. The panorama trail ends at an asphalted road, which we follow to the right until we reach the stairway of the mountain cemetery and thus return to our starting point at the car park. If the weather is good, you can take a refreshing swim in Lauda's open-air swimming pool.",

Now we cycle in the direction of Ruit, crossing the state road 1200 and descending the Lederberg to Hedelfingen. This passage requires some skill, if necessary pushing is called for.\r\n<br/>In Hedelfingen we briefly follow the main road before we face the considerable climb to \"Uncle Otto\". If we manage to look to the right despite the effort, we can catch a beautiful view over the roofs of Stuttgart, the Daimler Stadium or the vineyards near Esslingen. Once at the top, we can recover a little from the exertions of the climb in the beer garden of the excursion restaurant \"Onkel Otto\" before we continue our tour in the direction of the TV tower. Here we partly cycle on public roads, but they are not very busy. If you like, you can also take the forest path on the right, parallel to the road.\r\n<br/><p>Before we reach the TV tower, we have to conquer another climb. Then we cycle steadily slightly downhill parallel to the Filderlinie back to Plieningen. Behind the oak grove, a final, somewhat steeper descent requires a little skill depending on your speed. In addition, caution is advised here, as pedestrians may come towards us.\r\n</p>Finally, we ride along the Häslach forest and the Körsch river, take a last, short climb and get back to the starting point.",

Due to its central location, the municipal administration is also located here. Uttenhofen is mainly characterised by agriculture, but there is also a bakery and a country butcher's shop in the village where we can stock up on provisions.<br/> On our tour we cycle through Westheim, Sanzenbach, Bibersfeld and Raibach, all of which are beautifully embedded between the fields.

The Brenzpark recreation area was formerly the Landesgartenschau grounds. Past the sun and time path - a combination of sundial, celestial globe, planetary path, zodiac and time path - the route continues to Schnaitheim with the landmark of the district - the Schnaitheim mill.\n<br/>In Schnaitheim we first cross the Brenz and then the railway tracks. Now the Steigstraße leads us up to the car park at the Hirschhalde quarry, where the circular trail begins. At the sign \"Waldweg gesperrt\" (forest path closed) on the right, we walk towards the barrier and continue straight ahead to the quarry. At the beginning of the 18th century, oolite (sedimentary rock) was quarried here. As we continue, we come to an open space with a fireplace. At the end of the open space we follow the footpath into the forest, after about 50 m we go left down a steep footpath to the hairpin bend of a gravel path, where we keep to the right and follow the Hirschhaldeweg almost to the Schnaitheim ski lift. Shortly before, however, we turn right and after 200 m turn left along the edge of the forest, always straight ahead through the meadow valley to an oak tree at the end of the valley. Here we go left up the hill to a gravel path, which we cross, walk again on grassy path for a bit to the next gravel path and turn right into it. We always stay on the path, cross a junction and keep following the path. At the top of the hill, turn left at a crossroads to the ski lift viewpoint. Back on the gravel path, we follow it to the Hirschhalde-Steinbruch car park, from where we return to Friedrich-Degerler-Platz along the same route as the outward walk. In the Brenzpark we can enjoy some refreshments in the beer garden.",

We follow the course of the road to the left and then turn right into Kleinaigner Straße. This leads us out of Eschlkam across the Chamb in the direction of Kleinaign. There, shortly after entering the village, we turn left and follow the signs for cycle route 2 (yellow sign with black 2). At the next junction with Schützenstraße, the signposts show us the way to the left. This leads us out of Kleinaign. Soon we meet a through road at a T-junction, which we follow to the left. At the Jakobsmühle hamlet, we turn left into Austraße. On the following stretch of road, we ride towards the Hoher Bogen with a very beautiful view. At the next junction at the hamlet of Unterfaustern, we turn right towards Oberfaustern, Multererhof and Aignhof. This road eventually joins another one, which we follow to the right. Soon we reach the beautifully situated village of Neukirchen b. Hl. Blut. In the village we follow the markings to the left into Freybachstraße and immediately turn left again into Hohenbogenstraße. At the tourist information office and the pilgrimage museum, Hohenbogenstraße meets the main road, which we follow to the left. At the entrance to the village, behind the pilgrimage church of the Nativity of Mary, we turn right into Hinterbuchberger Straße. The pilgrimage church from the 16th century is well worth seeing. Behind the magnificent high altar is the smaller church of the Franciscan monastery founded in 1656. We reach this through a separate entrance. The high altar is also used from this side. The legend of the Holy Blood, on which the Neukirchen Marian pilgrimage is based, dates back to the Hussite invasion in the 15th century. After visiting the pilgrimage church, we drive out of Neukirchen via Hinterbuchberger Straße. Via Hinterbuchberg we reach the village of Warzenried. There we turn right at the T-junction towards Jägershof. At the end of Warzenried we follow the cycle path signs to the left into Böhmerwaldstraße. This leads us beautifully along the edge of the forest along the border to the Czech Republic past the hamlet of Neuschwarzau. We follow the road to the left in the direction of Seugenhof. In the following section, we ride along a beautiful route through the forest. Soon after leaving it, we reach Seugenhof, where we follow the signs to the right into Schmiedweg. This leads into a road, into which we turn right. We follow the course of the main road until we come to a larger road. We follow this to the left in the direction of Großaign, on the cycle path running parallel to the road. Before the bridge over the Chamb, we can turn right to the nearby natural swimming pond, which invites us to refresh ourselves in the warm seasons. After passing the bridge over the Chamb, we follow Großaigner Straße straight ahead. At the tourist information office, we turn left back to the starting point. Here we can visit an exhibition on the life of the writer Maximilian Schmidt, known as \"Waldschmidt\", in the nearby \"Gasthof zur Post\" at no. 14 Waldschmidtstraße. He was one of the favourite authors of the Bavarian King Ludwig II and the Prince Regent Luitpold. In addition to his successful literary work, he founded the Bavarian Tourist Association in 1890 and was one of the initiators of the Trachtenfest (traditional costume festival), to which the procession of the Wiesenwirte (meadow innkeepers) at the Munich Oktoberfest goes back.",

At the next intersection we cycle right into Dr.-Stich-Straße and pass the church \"Mariä Himmelfahrt\" and the cemeteries. Past the hikers' car park, the road \"Schanzenweg\" leads steeply uphill. Shortly after the woodland, we follow the road on the right. As we continue uphill, we enjoy the view of the Deggendorf valley and the Danube plain. We reach a road, cross it and shortly afterwards reach the village. We continue to follow the road, do not turn off to Grimming, pass through Ucking and reach Görgen. Also on this stretch we have an excellent view over the Danube valley and with luck up to the Alps. Behind the village, the road leads into a through road, which we follow to the right. We also cycle to the right at the next junction. Soon we turn right and follow the road downhill. At the bus stop Nemering we leave the through road and turn left into the village. Behind a left-hand bend with rustic farms, we change to a field path on the left, continue to keep left behind the houses and finally turn right onto a field path that takes us to Nadling. We reach the village tavern, turn left and follow the hiking trail (white 18 on red circle) towards Rusel and reach the hikers' car park with information board. The Lehnerhof inn with red deer enclosure is a good place to stop. We follow the sign to Freiberg and hiking trail no. 8 to Rusel. After about 50 m we leave the road and continue on the forest path (No. 8) until we reach a turning point. Here we follow the forest path in the direction of Rusel until we reach another turning point and cycle on the forest path at the same level until we reach the ski slope. The forest finally opens up and a beautiful view awaits us. We cross a second ski slope and reach the through road. About 50 m to our right we see the Berghof Rusel in front of us. It is no longer possible to stop here, the restaurant was closed in 2009. Follow the path to the left just before the road (No. 8 and green triangle) and cycle parallel to the road up to the Ruselabsatz. At the end of the car park, we cycle on the forest path in the direction of Landshuter Haus - until we reach a fork. We turn left onto the \"Böhmweg\". It goes downhill to Oberfrohnreuth (stone pillar and information board). We stay on the Böhmweg, which is marked with a black wagon wheel, and enjoy the downhill stretch on forest paths. Finally we reach Greising with a pretty pilgrimage church and inn. We continue to follow the Böhmweg - once again it's a rapid downhill to the village of Tattenberg. Following the track of the wagon wheel, we reach a forest path. We follow this, past a memorial with a beautiful view, and can once again let the wheels run. Finally we reach a settlement. We turn left onto the road and cycle along the Tattenbach stream until we reach the Ruselberg road, onto which we turn right. We now cycle about 4 km on the cycle lane, always downhill through Maxhofen and Mietraching to Deggendorf. On the left side of the road, already in Deggendorf, we find the restaurant Bayerwald. Here we turn left into Prellinger Straße. Shortly afterwards we turn right into Walchstraße, then left into Amanstraße and straight on to the traffic-calmed zone of Oberer Stadtplatz. We drive across the historic square with the green, medieval town hall tower, the pretty, colourful houses and nice cafés. At the Marienbrunnen (Mary's Fountain) next to the Heilig-Grab-Kirche (Holy Sepulchre Church) we look back once more and shortly afterwards reach the Spitaltor.",

Some parts of the route are very strenuous, as they are often sunny and windy and lead across open spaces. However, there are also stretches with subdued, yet stimulating climatic stimuli at the edge of the forest or through loose buildings. In summer, thermal conditions are predominantly comfortable to cool. In winter, cold stimuli are often to be expected. <br/>In the \"place of power\", one can find the way to inner harmony and physical and mental balance through deep relaxation and tranquillity.

We cross the tracks and walk south through the Glockengraben and Dittigheimer Straße parallel to the tracks until we meet the B27 federal road. On the opposite side of the road, we now turn right. First parallel to the main road, later to Dittwarer Straße, we walk sometimes along the edge of the forest, sometimes in the pine forest, until we reach the beautiful district of Dittwar, which we cross on Talstraße and Gissigheimer Straße. The baroque church of St. Laurentius is worth a look. At the last houses of Dittwar, we change to a field path to our right, which we follow for a while. We pass vineyards, of which the \"Dittwarer Oelkuchen\" vineyard enjoys a particularly good reputation. At a fork in the road near a group of trees, we take the right-hand path, then turn left and right again at the next four-way intersection and walk along the edge of the forest for a while. At the fourth fork to the left, we turn off, go right at the next opportunity and immediately left again. This path leads us in wide loops through the fields, meadows and vineyards until we meet the B27 again at Königheim. After crossing the main road, we walk through the wine village of Königheim with its 900-year-old wine press tradition. In spring and autumn, when the wine taverns are open, we can take a break at the Geier eco-winery. Shortly before a roundabout, we change again to the other side of the B27 and walk past the gymnasium on the left, then always straight ahead between the edge of the forest and the Brehmbach. A long way past the sewage treatment plant, a large piece of forest appears to the left of the main road. Here we cross the B27 for the last time and after a few metres turn left into the forest. We follow the path through the woodland over the Stammberg and further through fields and meadows to Tauberbischofsheim. The Stammbergweg, which we are now on, joins Königheimer Straße shortly before a roundabout. At the roundabout straight ahead, we reach the Glockengraben again via the main road, which brings us back to our starting point at the station. In the beer garden \"Hexenkessel\" or in the restaurant \"Zum alten Türmle\" we can end the hike in a cosy atmosphere.",

Behind the railway subway, a cycle path sign points us to the right. We now cycle along the tracks on a road with little traffic. From a distance we can already see Burglauer, our first stage destination. In the village we can visit the parish church of St. Peter and Paul. Along the Reichenbach stream, which accompanies us for a while, we leave the town and soon find a children's playground (1). As far as Niederlauer, we now use the cycle path next to the road. In the village, we follow the cycle path markings and cycle up the hill to the left, but should first take a look at the beautiful half-timbered house with stone gate in the centre of the village. Above Burglauer we cycle past an adventure playground. There are also several shady benches for resting, so we can stop here. We then turn right and immediately left again and reach the White Tower (2), which is accessible and offers a beautiful view over the valley of the Franconian Saale from above. The cycle path now leads us past fields and climbs moderately. We reach a section of forest near a stone statue of a saint and now cycle through the Steinacher Forst again on a sloping stretch in the direction of Windheim. Here we also follow the Franconian Marian Way for a while. We soon reach the connecting road between Roth and Reichenbach and have to cycle uphill on it for a short but steep stretch. At a forest road, we turn right and cycle through the Burglauer forest for a longer stretch until we meet a road. Turn right down a steep slope into the village of Windheim (3). Here you can stop at the inn \"Zur Traube\". We leave the village in a westerly direction and cycle past the church. After 100 m, turn left and cycle along field paths until you reach a road. We cross this road and continue to follow the cycle path markings, which point us in the direction of Haard at a crossroads. We reach a road, turn left and can already see the church tower of the village. Cross the sports facilities to reach the centre of the village and cycle past the church. The road goes uphill again until you see an information board on the right. It gives us an overview of the regional cycle path network. Our path takes us to the right here and we cycle across open fields again and have beautiful views over the surrounding countryside. Our next stage destination is Burghausen. The picturesque village lies at the foot of the Michelsberg, on which the ruins of a former pilgrimage church (4) stand. At the entrance to the village, we use a short stretch on the right through allotment gardens, ride past the church and out of the village. We now stay on the road until the end of our cycle tour and have to conquer the last ascent via a left turn through the forest before we can enjoy the long descent to the old town in Münnerstadt. Finally, we reach the Upper Gate. Via the market square we cycle into the old town and can still visit the sights and historical buildings such as the Jörgentor or the town parish church. Via Gymnasiumstraße we finally reach the car park at the station again and our destination.",

Immediately at the \"Edelweiß\" dairy, we turn west and continue along small roads until we meet the road from Waltenhofen to Buchenberg in Leutenhofen. After reaching the hamlet of Gösers  we turn left into the Wirlings forest. The cart track soon climbs steeply and joins the forest road leading from Buchenberg into Wirlinger Wald. At this junction, we cycle straight ahead and stay on the gravel road. The route crosses the \"Buchenberg-Weitnau\" cycle path on the former route of the Isny-Bähnle. We cycle straight up the hill to the Buchenberg - Weitnau link road, cross it and carry (or cycle) down the following steps. We continue over the bridge. There begins a meadow path that leads up into the village of Rechtis. In Rechtis our next destination the \"Sonneneck-Grat\" (partly also \"Sonneck\") is already signposted. We cycle down the path to the road and follow it until the path branches off to the right in Osterhofen, again in the direction of \"Sonneneck-Grat\". First we cycle steeply uphill on an asphalt path, then continue on a short gravel section. In the first sloping right-hand bend (approx. 13 km) we go straight ahead. We first have to lift the bike over a fence and then continue along the path to the ridge of the Sonneneck ridge. For many kilometres, forest and meadow paths alternate,  always along the ridge, the path finally leads steeply downhill to the Alttrauchburg castle inn. The old walls are an excursion destination that can also be reached by car. From the Alttrauchburg car park, a forest path leads us steeply downhill to Kleinweiler, where it joins a local road. We go straight through the village to Nellenbruck and continue on the main road to the cycle path towards \"Bolsternang\". In the village of Bolsternang, the beer garden of the \"Schwarzer Grat\" restaurant tempts you to stop for a break. This is also the name of our next but one destination. But first the route to \"Überruh\" is signposted. On the road past the clinic, we reach the forest road that leads to the Black Ridge. The last stretch (approx. 25 km) takes us up a steep trail to an observation tower, which promises a magnificent view. The trail leads back to the forest road and the Wenger Egg-Alpe, which is managed. From the alpine pasture, the forest road leads in the direction of \"Eschacher Weiher\" and joins the road from Kreuzthal to Eschach. In good weather, it is worth taking a detour to the lake. We continue on the road to the village of Eschach and on to Eschachried. Here a road turns off to the left in the direction of \"Wegscheidel/Wiggensbach\". At the hamlet of Bihls, we turn right into a small road through the hamlet of Bischlags, which later leads into a road that we cross a few metres further on to the right. You come to the cycle path that runs along the former route of the Isny-Bähnle to the left in the direction of \"Ermengerst\". Follow this cycle path via Ermengerst, there partly on asphalt, further leisurely downhill, past the Herrenwieser Weiher pond to Ahegg and to the Rottachmühle mill, where the gravel part of the cycle path ends. We cycle on asphalt past the Kempten town pond to the Mittlerer Ring and then continue to the right along the four-lane road in the direction of the main railway station.",

            "description_long": "Our day tour starts at the car park in front of the Wittmann inn. We find a panoramic map of the region on the left side, which we walk past and take the path through the village. Here we meet the marking \"Red triangle on a white background\" which will accompany us on our tour. The houses are soon behind us and we reach the Marienkapelle chapel at the edge of the forest. On a path we hike up the Gailenberg to Franzenshöhe. In the lower part we cross a forest path three times. Afterwards, the path leads us through a beautiful beech forest directly to the summit. There are now 200 metres of altitude difference between us and the starting point at the inn in Marienthal. On Franzenshöhe we find a stone roundel that was built at the beginning of the 20th century and served as a lookout point, but is now overgrown. We use the Peilstein for a good view of the surrounding countryside. A path leads us from the roundel in a westerly direction to this rock, from which we can see as far as Schwandorf and over the Upper Palatinate Lake District in good weather. After this detour, we continue south on the slightly sloping gravel path and reach a crossroads. Here we find a covered resting place and can take a rest. Our path leads us straight on to a junction that takes us right into the now denser forest. We walk across another junction, past large groups of boulders, up the Hohenstein. There we find a signpost to the Riedelhöhe. We turn left onto the path and discover the brick observation tower, which dates from the same time as the structure at Franzenshöhe. After climbing the tower, we return to the path and a little later reach the Wackelstein on the right. Strong hikers can make this granite block wobble with a chain. After these two sights, the path brings us to another crossroads, where we now turn left. A signpost here points us to Grafenwinn. Shortly afterwards, the path branches off. We keep to the right and walk on the gravel path through beautiful mixed forest over another junction and follow the markings \"Red triangle on a white background\". At a fork, we keep to the left and emerge from the forest and onto a meadow for the first time. A little later we reach a road and on it the village of Grafenwinn. Turn left at the chapel. At the hamlet of Hirtberg, we keep left again and reach Dürmaul. Passing the small cross on a stone pedestal, we now hike back up the mountain. At the beginning of the forest, we leave the road and hike right across the path onto a forest path that leads us to the left along the flank of the Jugenberg. Soon we meet the road again and follow it. In Eckartsreuth, we can make a detour to the Jugenberg mountain inn for a snack. You will find it at the end of the village. The trail continues along orchards through Gunt to Hof. In the centre of the village we can visit the castle \"Hof am Regen\" from the 12th century. At the fire station we turn left and at the following crossroads we keep to the right. We reach Stefling and walk up the unpaved road at the crucifix. Here we have the opportunity to take a look inside the castle. We leave the village in a westerly direction on the cycle path and reach an iron bridge at the Regen, which we cross. After the bridge, we turn left and walk along the banks of the Regen. Via the hamlet of Weißenhof we reach a ferry landing stage. There we have to call the ferryman, who eventually takes us to the inn. Here we have earned a hearty snack and can recover from the efforts of our day's hike.",

            "description_long": "From the starting point we walk downhill through the village in the direction of the secondary school. Behind the school, we turn right into the street \"Eckmühle\". After a few metres, we walk into the nature trail on the left side. Information boards inform us about various topics of the forest ecosystem. At a fork we turn left and walk to the Staffelbach. The hiking trail to Lake Freudensee is well signposted. We walk between the two streams and after a short stretch through the forest we pass some fish ponds. These were mentioned in a document as the prince-bishop's ponds in 1450 and are now privately owned. We cross the through road on a small bridge and walk to the shore of the Freudensee. The centuries-old reservoir is about eight hectares in size. It was dammed to supply a hammer mill with energy by water power. Today it is used for power generation and recreation. A natural open-air swimming pool invites you to swim in summer. A 2.5 km long circular path runs around the lake directly on the shore. After visiting the lake, we might treat ourselves to a break at the Hotel-Restaurant Seehof, while the children can still stay in the playground. Finally, we continue to the right behind the hotel on a small asphalt road. Behind the subway, we hike up the slope. In front of the Staffenöd estate, we turn left onto the tarred path and hike to the edge of the forest. Here we turn right and walk steeply up the slope. From here we already have a fantastic view across a meadow orchard to the town of Hauzenberg. A few metres later, the forest that covers the Staffelberg begins. First we hike on a well-maintained path through the mixed forest. After a good 1 km, we turn right onto a path. This ascent is clearly signposted with a signpost. The waymarking on the trees consists of two horizontal bars in black and white. After a steep climb, we are on the summit ridge of the Staffelberg. After a picnic at the rest area, we climb the wooden lookout tower and enjoy the expansive view of the region. On a metal sign we read that on a clear day we can even see as far as the Großer Arber, the highest peak in the Bavarian Forest. Behind the lookout tower we go downhill again. The path is not easy to see, especially at the beginning, and we carefully walk down the slope. Soon the path widens again, the marking now consists of two white bars and the white \"9\". We cross a wide forest road and walk along the path until we reach the foothills of Hauzenberg. Now we hike to the right on the narrow asphalt road and turn left behind the village of Schröck. Here we continue along the road until we reach the Eckmühle. The former water mill is now a residential building. We leave the asphalt road and enter the forest on the left. We follow the Staffelbach stream to a road and turn right up to the Hauzenberg sports stadium. The Staffelstraße leads us further uphill until we reach the well-kept town centre. At the highest point we find the town's parish church, which we have already seen from Staffelberg. The church, designed as a central building, was completed in 1975. Parts of the old neo-Gothic church are still standing right next to the new building. We go inside and see a large interior, which was calmly designed with a lot of wood, bricks and exposed concrete. After the visit, we walk on the church forecourt downhill to the right through the village back to the starting point.",

At the end of Habischried, we follow the signs to \"Burggrafenried\" to the left. The asphalted access road leads in a large arc around the Burggrafener Senke. We enjoy beautiful views of the peaks of the Bavarian Forest. Now we drive to the last houses of the village of Burggrafenried. There we keep to the right on a grassy path towards the forest. At the first fork in the forest, we do not follow the sign \"9\", but stay left. The path leads steeply downhill and we soon reach the first houses of Göttleinsberg. From the dead-straight access road leading into the village, a gravel path branches off to the right to the pond. It leads us further downhill and on a sloping path to Gottlesried. Every now and then, when the forest recedes, we can enjoy fantastic views to the north. In Gottlesried we let ourselves roll down the steeply sloping asphalt road on the left. In the valley we cross the railway line. Immediately after the bridge, we take the narrow asphalt road to the right. The animal shelter is signposted. We stay to the left of the railway tracks for the next kilometres and ride slightly downhill to Schwaighof. There we cross the tracks at a level crossing and climb the dirt road up the slope. The climb is only 300 m long, then we are already in the forest and ride on the wide main path to the left. After half a kilometre, when we meet the turnoff to Regen, we turn left, downhill again. At the lowest point we cross the Thurnbach in Kühhof. Behind Oberneumais the road rises again. Now we follow the signs to \"Regen via Rohrbach\". It leads us reliably along a field path to the railway line to Regen. We continue along the municipal hill to a railway subway. The subsequent climb to Rohrbach is short but very steep. In Rohrbach we cycle left and 50 m later right to the southern tip of the Ochsenberg. We first stay on the edge of the forest for 50 m, then a path branches off to the right, marked only with an inconspicuous green arrow. Here we go uphill. At the end of the forest, we keep to the right and continue climbing uphill, crossing a small stream and reaching the first residential houses of March. We go around March to the north. At the hiking mark to Leuthen, we leave the road to the right. On this field path we reach a large forest area around the Rabenstein. Along the green arrow the partly impassable trail leads to Leuthen. There, at the main road, we turn left to the next large junction in 2 km. Downhill to the right we reach Edhof. In a wide curve we cross the railway tracks and climb up to Zierbach. In Göttleinsberg at the chapel we keep to the right and roll downhill for several km with a beautiful view to the north. 500 m after the railway subway we turn left to Auerbach. Now we have reached the lowest point before the biggest climb of the tour. We ride left through the railway subway and at the first junction right over the Auerbach up a very steep climb. In Zachenberg we turn left onto the ring road and then the main road. The road climbs steadily to Kleinried. In the village, the Café Mariandl invites you to take a break. We keep going uphill and after a strenuous climb we reach the Habischebene. Now we roll along the southern side of the Klingerinhöhe towards Habischried. Above the village, our path branches off to the right to the Geißkopfbahn, our starting point.",

            "description_long": "The tour begins in the market town of Perlesreut. The town is one of the oldest settlements in the district and was granted market rights as early as 1650. The market street and the Gothic church are particularly worth seeing. The town's elevated position along a mountain ridge with a wide view of the surrounding area is particularly impressive. We turn west into Obere Marktstraße and follow hiking trail \"5\" to the right into St. Gunther-Straße. At the next fork, we turn left until we reach a road with heavier traffic. We follow this to the right until, in the wooded area on the left, a small road leads uphill, marked with several hiking trail numbers. Follow the road downhill across the fields, then take a forest path through the forest until you come out again into a pretty green valley with some settlements. The path ends at a road. We turn right and cross the stream. Shortly afterwards, we turn left onto the forest path. We go through the forest again, across a babbling brook, until we reach the road at the cross. Here we turn right onto the road, which now leads steadily uphill around the slope to Rentpoldenreuth. We continue straight on through the hamlet until we reach the road again shortly afterwards, onto which we turn left. Behind the wooded area, we ride through a moss with a reed area and turn off at a bus stop and at the signpost to Grotting. We pass the village and a riding stable and cycle to the right at the next junction towards Seiboldenreuth. We cycle through this quaint village with a narrow lane and red deer enclosure. As far as Neudorf, the route runs over a hill with excellent views into the Bavarian Forest and to its peaks, e.g. the striking, bare Lusen. In Neudorf we follow the main road to Grafenau, turn right behind the modern church to the riding stable and then turn left again at the next opportunity. We pass the riding arena, turn left at the first forest road and continue across the fields on a hill with a beautiful view of the national park area. At a row of trees we turn left, and a few metres further on we turn right again. Continue straight ahead towards the village of Lichteneck. We follow the main road briefly to the right until we reach the Grafenau Ost/Freibad junction and descend Freyunger Straße. At the car park we turn into the Kurpark and then keep along the southern, left-hand side of the lakes to enjoy the view of Grafenau from here. We pass interesting games of skill reminiscent of modern sculptures, a Kneipp facility and restored farmhouses, which also house the Farm Furniture Museum. The path ends at Spitalstraße, into which we turn right to cycle past the former hospital building, the snuff museum and up the steep hill to the right to the town square. Grafenau is the oldest town foundation in the Bavarian Forest and the colourful town square ensemble is a listed building. The highlight is the Old Town Hall crowned with battlements in Gothic style. You will find very nice cafés and restaurants on the square. After a stroll through the square, we cycle back to Spitalstraße, cross the main road and cycle past the summer toboggan run into the district of Schlag. We cycle south along the road lined with birch trees through the Stockerbachtal valley. The way back is now mainly downhill. Finally, we take the turnoff onto a smaller road to Heinrichsreit. The road to Perlesreut delights the cyclist with a varied, hilly landscape and through small hamlets such as Bibereck and Nebling. At the end of Lindberg, we turn right and reach our starting point via the Upper Market Square.",

At the right edge of the valley, a meadow path leads us uphill and through a short section of forest. We reach the road \"An der Klappermühle\" which leads up to the village of Weickersgrüben. On the left side of the road are two old, lovingly renovated buildings. The house with blue shutters and an old water wheel is the so-called \"<strong>Klappermühle</strong>\".\n</p><p>We continue along the road to the centre of the village and turn sharp left at a lime tree into Blumenstraße. In front of a large wooden house, a path leads us uphill at an acute angle to the right. We finally turn right towards the forest, which we reach at a rest area under large <strong>deciduous trees </strong>with many tables and benches. We enjoy the view over the fields and the hilly landscape, then we continue hiking uphill through the beech forest and reach a platform.</p>\n<p>We turn left onto the gravel path and follow it until it would lead out of the forest after a left turn. However, we go downhill to the right on a forest path that runs along the edge of the field. We come across a gravel path with trail markings \"2\" and \"3\" and turn right. The path first leads through mixed forest, then under a canopy of hazel bushes and fruit trees between fields.</p>\n<p>At a fork in the path, we keep to the right, then shortly afterwards turn right into Weickersgrübener Weg. At a fountain in the hamlet of Ochsenthal we enjoy the refreshing water and then turn right to the Sodenberg inn. At the deer enclosure with an information board on deer, the road turns into a path. At the next crossroads we go straight on, following hiking trail \"4\". A forest path leads quite steeply uphill and then in an arc to a clearing. We follow the lower, longitudinal edge of the field until we reach a cross path. Now we hike right uphill to a gate, where a path leads us to the left to the summit of the <strong>Sodenberg,</strong> one of the southernmost Rhön volcanoes. We are rewarded for the climb with a wonderful panoramic view.</p>\n<p>Back at the gate, we follow the wide gravel path straight ahead. This runs in a right-hand bend to the <strong>Gasthof Sodenberg.</strong> A board informs us about the Sodenberger Gans nature reserve. We like to stop at the historic inn with its beautiful beer garden before following the road for a while. At the next junction we go right uphill towards the forest, then keep left at the edge of the forest. The path leads into the mixed forest. Only at the third fork do we turn right. We pass a signpost to the chapel and soon reach a platform.</p>\n<p>From here we have the option of turning left onto a path that leads us along a steep edge with a view of the Saale valley to the former pit of the <strong>basalt works</strong>. The view into the 70 m deep quarry is very impressive. In an adjoining refuge, we read about the history of the mine, which was worked between 1904 and 1958, and learn about the flora and fauna of the region.</p>\n<p>Then we continue hiking until a field appears on our left. We keep to the left downhill at the edge of the forest and, keeping to the left, we come back to the forest path we already know. This time we go steeply downhill and straight back to Ochsenthal. We cross the village with its many half-timbered houses and floral decorations and continue towards Morlesau. At the transformer house, turn left onto a path with grass strips. The path leads westwards above the Franconian Saale with a view of Morlesau. Soon we approach the natural <strong>bank</strong> of the river on a footpath across meadows. Finally, we reach the Roßmühle campsite again.</p>",

The idyllically situated village, close to nature, with its old farmhouses and beautiful farm gardens is well worth a visit. A visit in the summer months is a feast for the eyes because of the diverse flowers. Furthermore, beautiful circular hiking trails invite you to take a walk with a magnificent panoramic view, e.g. the 13 km long circular hiking trail \"Panorama\". The hiking trail consists mainly of field and forest paths. From Weickenreuth you go to Untersauerhof and from there to Förstenreuth. The restored old flax house is worth seeing here. Via Höhlmühle, the route then leads to Marienweiher, a place of pilgrimage with a beautiful basilica. From there you reach Weickenreuth via Kosermühle, through the romantic Kosertal valley. There are rest and refreshment opportunities in the well-kept restaurants in the villages along the way.",

At the foot of the Unternberg, between the Raffneralm and Stocking, lies the exciting and well prepared toboggan run in Ruhpolding. The ascent path runs separately to the toboggan run, so that a beautiful and relaxed winter hike precedes the tobogganing fun. Furthermore, we have an additional place to stop here, the vineyard. The Raffneralm is also very traditional, and this is where the fast track starts, on which we whiz back down into the valley. There are no curves on the rather steep track and snow is guaranteed due to the northern exposure: So it's not for tobogganing beginners!",

From there we walk from Schlossstraße into Kirchstraße, turn right and reach Untere Marktstraße via the market square. We follow Auerbachstraße to the right for a short distance before leaving it to the left via Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Straße. We walk along this road for quite a while until we cross Bergstraße and turn diagonally left onto Zur Alm. We walk out of the town into the forest and turn left not at the first junction, but at the first crossroads. On this path we reach the street Körnerberg and turn right onto the Kamerunweg, on which we stay for some time before we follow the Waldhäuserweg to the left. We cross the Waldgutstraße and go straight on the Höhenweg, which we soon leave to the left via the Kammweg. Now we walk parallel to the German-Czech border, which is why the Kammweg also becomes the border road. After a bend to the right, we continue on the border path until we reach the road Am Aschberg. This leads us into the forest, where we meet the Aschbergstraße and follow it to the left. We meet the border road again, follow it to the left and take the third turn to the left. Via the \"Himmelsleiter\" (ladder to heaven) we reach the Zollstraße in Sachsenberg-Georgenthal and cross the municipality by changing from the Zollstraße a short distance to the right onto the Auerbachstraße and then continue immediately to the right on the Pestalozzistraße. This takes us out of the village. We go through a short stretch of forest and meet the forest road, which we follow to the left. Soon we meet the state road Falkensteiner Straße, take it to the right and then turn left into Fuchslochweg. We keep left and then turn sharp right onto Schulstraße. We turn diagonally left across Schulstraße and Siedlerstraße into the forest. In the forest, our path bends to the left both at the first junction and shortly afterwards at a T-junction. After a while, our path runs parallel to the Alte Kottenheider Straße for a short distance, but then leads us further through the forest to the right. After a right-hand bend, our path again comes to a T-junction, where we continue to the left. A little later we leave the forest and reach the street Amtsberg. This is also the location of the Klingenthal Zoo, which we can visit after our hike. Via Kirchstraße and Schlossstraße we return to our starting point, the Tourist Information.\n<br/>Directly next to the Tourist Information is the Music and Winter Sports Museum, which is well worth a visit. It is also worth taking a detour to the round church \"Zum Friedefürsten\" or to the Schaumanufaktur for accordion and harmonica making.",

            "description_short": "This hike takes us mainly through woodland to the Kissinger Hütte on the Feuerberg and back to Langenleiten via the basalt works.",
            "description_long": "At the entrance to Langenleiten, follow the signpost to Kissinger Hütte. A wide forest path leads leisurely uphill and soon into the forest. On the left side of the path is a meadow. At the end of the meadow, near a bench, a path turns left into the forest. We follow the marking \"black, empty triangle with double bar\". A wooden sign points us to the mountain path to the Kissinger Hut. It is quite steep and goes uphill in a few twists and turns. Somewhat flatter, the path leads through low beech trees (1) bent by the weather. Under natural conditions, beech would be by far the predominant tree species in the Rhön. Medieval records of Fulda monks refer to the Rhön as \"Buchonia\", land of virgin beech forests. Large-scale clearing in the Middle Ages created the \"Land of Open Distances\". It was not until 1730 that spruce was introduced by foresters. Increasingly, spruce is again being replaced by the more robust beech, as snow and storms cause great losses in the spruce forest. We walk across a mountain meadow directly to the Kissinger Hut (2), already built in 1914 and thus the oldest hikers' accommodation far and wide in the Rhön, welcomes us with a magnificent view, wooden sun loungers and a large children's playground. Here we also find the mountain station of the chairlift. The house of the Rhön Club is located in the midst of the magnificent low mountain range landscape \"Naturpark Rhön\" with a view of the Kreuzberg (928 m above sea level). The Kreuzberg, the holy mountain of the Franconians, is the highest excursion destination in the Bavarian Rhön. Every year, 70 to 80 pilgrimages take place to the \"holy mountain\". It can also be recognised by the broadcasting station of the Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation from 1951. Incidentally, the name \"Rhön\" is often derived from the Celtic \"raino\" (hilly). Numerous treeless hilltops characterise the image of this landscape in the border triangle of Bavaria, Hesse and Thuringia - witnesses to a volcanic past. Valuable landscape areas, deciduous and mixed forests, hedgerow landscapes and unique flora and fauna are the basis for the Rhön being recognised as a UNESCO biosphere reserve in 1991. The round basalt shapes are covered by green bristly grass meadows where the black-headed Rhön sheep graze. The Rhön sheep is one of the oldest livestock breeds in Germany. Since 1983, the population has been increasing again with the initiative of the \"Zuchtgemeinschaft Rhönschafe\" (Rhön Sheep Breeding Association). After enjoying the panoramic view, we walk to the left of the hut straight south towards the forest. Then we walk downhill on a forest path without many bends. We reach a crossroads and turn left. The gravel path leads between the active basalt plant (3) and the basalt pits to the road. The Rhön is still a main mining area for basalt in Germany. The hard, almost black basalt gravel is particularly suitable for the substructure of roads and railway tracks. We follow the wide gravel path about 200 m downhill to the left. At the second junction we leave the road and follow the gravel path marked \"yellow drop\". We hike about 1.5 km on the comfortable path. After a bend to the left, we turn right at a hunter's stand onto a forest path. This leads downhill and soon meets a cross path, which we follow to the right. The path goes downhill to a clearing. We walk along the edge of the meadow to the left until a blue hiking trail sign with the number three points us to the right. We walk straight downhill on a path through a high meadow and come back to the starting point of the hike. In Langenleiten, a street village with well-kept estates, we can finish the hike in the \"Linde\" inn.",

            "description_long": "<p>We start our very eventful tour in Sonnenbühl-Erpfingen. The history of the village goes back a long way, because human traces from prehistoric times, i.e. stone and bone tools, have been found nearby (Karlshöhle, half-caves of the Gruppenlochfelsen). The first permanent settlement of Erpfingen probably took place around 400 BC.<br/>We start our tour and soon reach the first highlight: the Bärenhöhle on the Höllberg. Together with the Karlshöhle, it is one of the most popular show caves in the Swabian Alb and even in the whole of Germany. The Bear Cave and the Karl Cave describe a coherent cave system, which is why the two parts are often combined under the term \"Bear Cave\". Not only have skeletal parts of bears been found here, which probably used this cave as their winter quarters some 50,000 to 20,000 years ago, but also traces of people from the last Ice Age and the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Visitors are particularly impressed by the beautiful stalactite variations that run through the caves.<br/>After visiting the caves, the tour continues through fields and forests to Lichtenstein Castle. The castle, which looks like something out of a romantic fairytale, was built in the 19th century at an altitude of over 800m. It owes its appearance to the novel \"Lichtenstein\" by Wilhelm Hauff, after which the castle was built. It is still owned by the ducal building family (Count Wilhelm von Württemberg and Duke von Urach). A guided tour takes you inside the castle and later you can enjoy a wonderful view over the Echa valley and the Albrauf rocks from the lookout rock near the castle.</p>",

            "description_long": "From the tourist information office we ride downhill. At the lowest point, before the bridge over the Weiße Regen, we turn left towards Riedermühle and Thürnstein. This is where the Lamer-Winkel-Arber cycle path begins. Behind Thürnstein we pass the through road, but after only a few metres we turn right into the Tierparkweg in the direction of Schwarzau. We continue cycling and arrive at the entrance to the Bayerwald-Tierpark Lohberg. More than 400 native animals live here. During a visit we can observe lynx, wolf, deer or snowy owl in their natural habitat. We meet the through road again for a few metres, then turn right and continue towards Sommerau. In the village of Sommerau we follow the signpost to Kleiner Arbersee. For the first time, dense fir forest lines our route, the path becomes dark and shady. We cycle on to the car park in the forest and follow the asphalt path deeper into the forest. Up to this point we have cycled moderately up the slope. From here on the path becomes steep and we can test our fitness over the next 3 km. At a fork we decide to leave the Lamer-Winkel-Arber cycle path for now and continue straight ahead to the Kleiner Arbersee lake. We continue up the mountain and finally turn off onto a forest path. On the shore of the mountain lake we realise that the detour was worthwhile. The Kleine Arbersee was formed during the last ice age. It is ten metres deep at its deepest point. In 1889, it was dammed for timber drifting. In the process, three large parts of the moor detached themselves from the subsoil and have been floating on the lake as islands ever since. They are home to rare plants and animals. The Gläserner Steig hiking trail also runs along the shore. From the early 17th century onwards, there were several glassworks in the region around the Arber that produced mirrors and utility glass. On the further course through the forest we cycle through some small watercourses until we come to a fork. We cycle to the Mooshütte mountain inn and take advantage of this stop for refreshments before we cycle up the incline to the Brennes saddle. From Brennes we enjoy the wide view of the Arber and over the Bavarian Forest. From here we descend the steep mountain path behind the Brennes mountain hotel towards Grafhütte. Here the Lamer-Winkel-Arber cycle path is signposted. We follow the Teufelsbach stream and arrive at the Arberhütte hut in a clearing. Several buildings on a meadow orchard show us the traditional building style of the region. We cycle down the slope and follow the signs pointing us into Bayerisch Eisenstein. The tourist information office marks the turning point of our mountain bike tour. After taking a look at the border town to the Czech Republic, we cycle back to the sports fields and follow the signs towards Großer Arbersee. Shortly before the Arberseehaus we come out of the forest and cycle to the Großer Arbersee. This lake was also formed during the last ice age. Several islands float on the 157-hectare surface. We cycle left of the war memorial into the forest and take the steep climb towards Brennessattel. Via the valley station of the Arber cable car we continue to Brennes and take the path back that we already know from the journey here. Behind the Mooshütte mountain inn, we reach the forest junction again and choose the right-hand path, which is indicated by the sign of the Lamer-Winkel-Arber cycle path. At another fork, we return to the narrow asphalt path in the direction of Sommerau, Thürnstein and back to Lam.",

We use the path that runs parallel on the right-hand side. After 500 m, this becomes a cycle path and leads out of Mellrichstadt. At the end of the village we find the first tour marker: the green bicycle on a white background, which points us to Oberstreu. We cycle across open fields to the sports field, then turn right and after 150 m turn left into Ziegelhüttenstraße. After 200 m we meet the Frickenhäuser Straße and enter Oberstreu. The parish church of St. Andreas (1) appears in front of us with its gaden, which served as a storehouse. We cycle around the church and out of the village on Brückenstraße. After the bridge, we turn left at the Mönchshof and reach a sawmill. After that, the path goes uphill via serpentines. We ride across open fields and can enjoy the beautiful view on this plateau. Then we enter the forest and pass under the motorway. Now we start our first longer descent over field paths, which we can enjoy all the way to Hendungen. Shortly before Hendungen, we turn right onto the road and in the village, at the left-hand bend with the wayside shrine, we ride straight ahead towards the cemetery. Our tour leads us on the Dorfgrabenstraße to a crossroads where we go straight on and leave the village via the Königshöfer Weg. At the beginning of the forest, a pond appears on the left side of the path, on the right a small chapel with benches. Here we can take a rest and gather strength, because now the second longer ascent begins. First through forest, later over orchards, we reach level terrain again and now cycle through mixed forest to a beautiful rest hut in the forest (2). The path here is sufficiently signposted so that we can easily find our way. The markings with the green bicycle on a white background show us the way. We soon reach a T-junction at the edge of the forest. Here we turn left, cycle around a right-hand bend and can already see the village of Rappershausen ahead of us. The trail descends slightly downhill along a dirt road until it joins an asphalt road. Take a left turn into the village, cross the main road and cycle past the community and sports centre. At the church we turn left and a short time later right into Behrunger Straße, which leads us out of the village. About halfway to Behrungen, we reach the Bavarian Border Open-Air Museum (3). The control and information facilities on the German division have been preserved and can be visited by appointment. Shortly before Behrungen, we leave the road in a wooded area and turn left onto a gravel path that leads us steeply downhill. Past the allotment gardens, we reach an asphalt road again, on which we reach the connecting road to Sondheim. Here we cycle left and over a hilltop into the village. At the church we cycle left and then turn right into Frankenstraße. After 200 m we turn right again into Rossriether Straße and now cycle under the motorway to Rossrieth. Behind the church is the moated castle (4), which is privately owned and not accessible. Over a final incline we climb the Berkacher Höhe and turn left on the crest into a field path. We now cycle back to Mellrichstadt via the Giebelsberg. We cycle over the federal road and on a sloping stretch we reach the railway tracks. Then we turn left into Mahlbachweg, cross the crossroads and arrive at the post office via Friedenstraße. Here we turn right and continue along Großenbergweg and Bahnhofsweg to the parish church. Soon we have reached the car park again and the destination of our tour.",

To the west, you can make out the mountains in Switzerland if you have the right distant view. <br/>Three steeply rising walls divide the entire area, Untere Gottesackerwände (1,858 m), Obere Gottesackerwände (2,033 m) and Ifenmauer (2,230 m). Many very attractive alpine flowers, as we know them from the rock garden, can be found up here, e.g. gentian and alpine silver mantle. In addition, the light-flooded mixed forests are rich in ferns, especially in the lower part of the Mahdtal valley. Smaller moors are also found in the lower-lying regions. Above, there are extensive mountain pine forests and wide grassy meadows next to the Schrattenkalk. The bizarre rock formations created by the rain, the so-called Schratten, are partly washed out into deep pools. In the Gottesacker area there are also some hut systems. Special caution is advised here when the snow cover is closed. <br/>During the ascent, we pass the 77 m deep entrance gorge of the Hölloch, a cave system that runs underneath the area. The explored and surveyed length is currently between 10 and 11 km. Already at the beginning of the 20th century, the first people were interested in this system of hills.\n<p>On the Gottesacker plateau lies the ruined Gottesacker alp. According to legend, this was a beautiful sunny alp with lush pastures. The alpine dairymen did not want anyone to share in their wealth. When an old man asked for a little lard, they gave him dung in disguise. As punishment, the alp sank with all its cattle, leaving behind what is now the Gottesacker plateau. A plaque at the alp informs exactly about this.</p>\n<p>The hunter and shepherd camp from prehistoric times, which we pass on the descent at the Schneiderkl;ren-Alpe, points to human settlement in the area as early as 7000 BC (Middle Stone Age). This dwelling was also used in the Neolithic, Broze and Iron Ages.</p>",

There we find a large oak tree with many waymarkers. We orientate ourselves on the Franconian Marian Way, which points us to Fridritt. Continue straight ahead on the forest road, past the oak tree and into the forest. We reach a crossroads where we turn left and now go downhill for a bit until we come to another crossroads. Here we keep to the right. We now cycle straight ahead until we reach a clearing. Now we cycle along the edge of the forest and past the Weißbildkapelle. Here we can take a rest on shady benches. We cycle downhill and reach the crossroads to Fridritt. A cycle path sign points to the left and we follow it into the village. Near the baroque parish church (1) we find a nice playground. We leave Fridritt via Kleinwenkheimer Straße and have to tackle a short climb straight away. Soon the road goes downhill again and we cycle past a wayside shrine into Kleinwenkheim. We reach the main road and turn left. At the end of the village we use the cycle path, where a signpost directs us towards Großwenkheim. Now we cycle across fields and meadows along the Wannigsbach stream and can already see the church spire of the village ahead of us. At the entrance to Großwenkheim, we turn right, then immediately left again and follow the cycle path markings. At the parish church, we cycle up to Bonifatiusplatz and can stop there at the \"Zum Adler\" inn (2). We then cycle down Bildhäuser Straße and turn right at Wannigsbach onto a field path. This brings us to a crossroads where we keep left. Now we cycle again on level ground through the open countryside and reach a crucifix, where we keep to the right. We cycle around the piece of forest ahead of us and reach Großbardorf at a beautiful playground (3) with resting benches on the outskirts of the village. After a breather, we turn left at the next junction. On a road with little traffic, the path now leads us through the beautiful Albachtal valley to Ober- and Untertannigsmühle. We cycle up another small incline and can already see Kleineibstadt ahead of us. We cycle downhill into the town and turn left before the small bridge. We now come to a crossroads along the stream. Here we turn right onto the main road and after 100 m turn left onto the cycle path. We reach the Fränkische Saale, which we now follow to Saal. Shortly before the town, we cross the river at an information board about the region's cycle path network and also discover a signpost pointing us to Maria Bildhausen. We ride across the road and at a right-hand bend straight ahead until we meet the Raiffeisenstraße. Here we turn left. Now the only longer ascent on our cycle tour begins. We cycle out of the village and at a fork we choose the right-hand path. A short time later, a pond (4) appears in front of us. We cycle past it on the right and up to the edge of the forest. There are benches here, with a small stream flowing past. We can rest here once more and then tackle the climb through the forest. We finally reach the gravel hill at a large crossroads and have climbed the incline. Now we go downhill for a long stretch and after a pond we reach the Maria Bildhausen golf course (5), which we pass through. At the car park we turn right and come across a road. Here we keep right and at the following turn-off to the monastery we turn right again. We cycle through the inner courtyard and can stop at the monastery inn before arriving back at the car park and the destination of our cycle tour.",

Behind it, follow the course of the Steinbach stream to the football pitch. Above the football green, we go downhill to the right and along a narrow path through the Steinbach Valley nature reserve. A footbridge leads us across the Bühler. On the other bank, the Bühlerau meadows begin, which we hike through until we reach the Eschenau mill.

A bench near a sculpture of a woman (2) invites you to take a rest. At the edge of the field, we keep left and pass the hang-gliding field (3). Passing between vines (4), we now descend again to Hammelburg.",

The \"Einkehr\" becomes problematic on weekends as early as 11 am. We should also not try to move from one tent to the next and drink a beer everywhere. Firstly, no one can tolerate one Maß per tent, and secondly, this is no way to develop a cosy society. That is important. You realise this at the latest when, after the fourth Maß, you are lying in the arms of the gentleman/lady to your left and making eternal vows of friendship or a marriage vow.</p>\n<p>Rides are dangerous. For some, however, they unfortunately only become interesting after a few beers. But that can end badly - literally. It's best to ride a few rounds of the carousel before visiting a beer tent and then we can concentrate on the really important things in life: Beer, atmosphere, chicken. The latter is the bone of contention every year, because on the one hand, half a chicken in the tents is usually immensely expensive, on the other hand, there is probably nowhere else you can get such a perfect fried chicken as at the Wiesn. The same goes for the beer. No matter which brewery we choose - the festival beer is good everywhere. Incidentally, it's a little stronger than the beer usually available, something that many newcomers and even more Italians have had to bitterly atone for.</p>\n<p>Festival acquaintances are quickly made and even more quickly forgotten. Sometimes they end up on the slopes of the Theresienhöhe in front of the Bavaria and sometimes with being thrown out of the festival tent. This usually happens when you assume that the waitress has given you \"clear signals\" and that she \"looks really great\". Never, really never, should the waitress be taken for more than she is: the bringer of beer. Everything else leads nowhere. She is not the marquee management, not the security, not the cigarette machine and definitely not a flirting opportunity.</p>>",

            "description_long": "We drive a short distance along the main road in the direction of Alpsee. About 100 m before the large farm at the Alpsee, we turn right onto a mountain path and follow the hiking signs to the \"Bärenfalle\". Through the town forest we ride in long serpentines on well-compacted gravel constantly uphill. A rather strenuous affair to begin with, but one that compensates us again and again with magnificent views down to the Alpsee. Shortly before the second cattle gate, we follow the path to the right to the \"Bärenfalle\". Behind a bumpy passage we reach the Bärenfalle alpine pasture, the \"Alpsee Bergwelt\" and the interesting climbing forest. Past the mountain station of the chairlift, we first take a narrow meadow path, later a mountain path - always following the hiking signs in the direction of Thalkirchdorf/Semmelalpe. Through beautiful alpine meadows, past small blocks of Nagelfluh, we reach an asphalt road. Later, we do not follow this downhill at all, but cycle straight ahead for a short distance to Leutenschwand Alpe. From here, a mountain path awaits us, which effortlessly manages to get our pulse going again. After a short, crisp climb, we ride through alpine pastures again, which can also be soggy in wet weather, to the Kuhschwand alpine pasture. From here we follow the later asphalted mountain path to the Moosalpe. Attention: Directly at the Moosalpe, we must not miss the turnoff in the direction of Buchenegg. A gravel path brings us down to the Sonnhalde alpine pasture. On the valley floor of this idyllic high valley we ride mostly flat at first, later again moderately steep down to the Weißach. We follow the mountain stream against the direction of flow on the left side to the valley station of the Hochgrat cable car. This also marks the beginning of the Ehrenschwang valley. Here we cross the Weißach and now follow the signs on the asphalt road in the direction of Immenstadt. This long high valley is populated with a few mountain huts, is only inhabited in summer and is not used except by agricultural and forestry traffic. All of the valley's routes come together again in the east at the end of the valley. We follow the road moderately uphill to the Hohe Brücke bridge. Here the water masses of the Weißach force their way through imposing rock faces with a loud roar. Shortly after the Hohe Brücke, we turn half-right onto the initially quite steep path. On a beautiful plateau, we finally ride along a rather idyllic stream with small gravel and sand banks, which invite us to take a short rest. Later we meet the asphalt path again, which we follow to the left to the Alpe Untereck. Here we should not miss the homemade mountain cheese. Afterwards, a wide gravel path leads us further in the direction of Immenstadt. After quite a while, this turns into a leisurely ascending root path that is sometimes a little difficult to ride. If the path seems too demanding: any pushing passages are always short-lived. Shortly after the Seifenmoosalpe, we meet a paved path again and follow it to the left to the Kemptner Naturfreundehaus. Up here, at the highest point of our tour, we have definitely earned a snack. From now on, it's almost all downhill - along a beautiful mountain path with repeated magnificent views of the Alpsee, we ride to Alpe Starkatsgund. In the middle part of this descent, it may be advisable to push the mountain bike over the approx. 100 m long coarse gravel passage. At the alp we keep left and follow the signs to Ratholz. We return through the town forest to our starting point at the car park of the \"Alpsee Bergwelt\".",

Here we take the path to the right, cross a junction and turn right again at the next fork. In front of us, fields appear on the left in the middle of the forest, along which we walk and pass the state road behind it. Then we continue straight ahead through the forest. We ignore three crossroads before we leave the path to the right. We walk through a forest area called Großer Riss. Down the valley we head towards Röthelstein. This rock soon rises to our right and over a bridge at its foot we reach the ascent by which we can climb the 35 m high viewing platform of the Röthelstein. After an extensive view of the surroundings, we walk back to Beerheide, where we take the Röthelsteinweg and the Birkenweg to the Obere Straße and finally to our starting point, the Kulturhaus.",

            "description_long": "A varied and scenic tobogganing tour takes us from the \"village of the kings' gorges\" Schwangau below the Säuling up to the Bleckenau mountain inn. The upper part of the trail in particular is hardly ever overrun, so we can look forward to a real winter experience here.  The Bleckenau mountain inn invites you to take a well-deserved rest. From the car park, we make our way to the lower end of the toboggan run. We therefore follow Alpseestraße and first orientate ourselves by the signs to Neuschwanstein Castle. After a bend to the left, we then turn right and follow the signs to \"Bleckenau\". After about 60 m we finally reach the toboggan run. After a good three-quarters of an hour of ascent we come to a crossroads - here we continue hiking uphill on the toboggan run. Then we can even toboggan down a little way to the bridge that crosses the Püllat, until we walk again and follow the river into the valley. After this passage was quite flat, it now goes somewhat steeper uphill in the hairpin bends. After the service hut, we keep to the left and can already see the Bleckenau mountain inn, our well-deserved stop for refreshments. Then we descend along the same path: The already familiar crossroads divides the descent into a more leisurely one in the first part and a faster one in the last part. Here the toboggan run is also much narrower and we toboggan down rapidly in a few bends to the footpath that leads to the castle. From here we carry or pull our toboggan until we reach the car park again.\r\n<p>Author: Hotel Maximilian</p>",

            "description_long": "The Innsbruck via ferrata (since 2003 officially named \"Panorama Klettersteig Hannes Gasser\") leads over a total of seven peaks always following the ridge of the Innsbruck Nordkette. The Nordkette cable car ensures a quick and comfortable ascent, and at the Seegrube station there is a restaurant with a sun terrace from which you can enjoy a magnificent panorama. The views of the Inntal valley with Innsbruck, the Stubai Alps and the Karwendel mountains along the entire trail are really something to behold. The protection of the trail is excellent, more than 2 km of steel rope and numerous step bars and pins guarantee a firm hold. The partly exposed route is exposed in all directions, but mainly on the east side. As the route is mainly on the ridge, stable weather conditions are an urgent prerequisite for an ascent. <br/>The first part leads from the mountain station to Kemacher (2480 m) and on to Langer Sattel (2258). Here you can break off the ascent and descend or continue - now much more difficult - to the Frau Hitt saddle. The via ferrata is usually climbed from east to west, but the reverse is also possible. The difficult entry point (C) at the beginning of the first part can be bypassed in an easier variant (A) on the right. The second part after the \"Frau Hitt\" begins with the key section of the entire climb in an overhanging wall section (C/D).\n<p> </p>",

            "description_long": "Our hike begins at Hammelburg's market square. The old Franconian wine town was first mentioned in a document in 716. The beautiful town hall and the Renaissance-style market fountain date back to the 16th century. If you are interested in the history of Hammelburg, you should buy the \"Little Guide\" at the tourist information on the market square. We walk along Bahnhofstraße, pass the Bürgerspitalkirche and reach a roundabout. The first turn-off leads us to the right into Seeshofer Straße, which passes under the railway tracks and merges into Kobelstraße. The marking \"Rhönclub hiking trail no. 3\" accompanies us. At the end of the street, we turn left into Pfaffstraße and immediately right again into Weberstraße. Follow the second road on the left, Faulstiegstraße, for about 1.5 km. The path leads gently uphill in a right-hand bend. We walk along the edge of the forest with a view of the Ganstal (1) below the Buchberg. At a hill we come to a fork in the path, which we follow to the left. From here, a gravel path leads through sparse pine forest until you reach another clearing. Our view opens up here over the vineyards to Saaleck Castle and the valley of the Franconian Saale. Saaleck Castle\" was built in the 12th century to protect Hammelburg. The shady path leads us in a loop back southwards and soon becomes a narrow forest path leading down towards the Thulba valley. We can take a break at a rest area (2) with a beautiful view. Our route continues steeply downhill through flowering meadows and comes across a cross path, which we follow to the right. Straight ahead, this path takes us leisurely downhill to Herbertsmühle in Untererthal. If you want to take a break in the village at the historic inn \"Zum Goldenen Kreuz\" (3), turn left at the mill, cross the river Thulba and follow the view of the church tower. Back at the bridge, follow the signpost \"1.4 kilometres to Obererthal\". Like the Thulba, the asphalt footpath and cycle path meanders past willows and alders to Obererthal. We meet the Kapellenweg, which leads to the left into the village, follow the Obererthal road to the right and reach the Gasthof \"Zum Stern\" with its own schnapps distillery. Hiking along the Kapellenweg to the right, we reach a crossroads. Walk straight ahead up the steep forest path. At the next crossroads, turn right. At the next two forks, we keep left and then follow the path sharply to the left until we reach the highest point and a chapel (4). Continue straight downhill on the wide gravel path until you reach a valley again, where you turn left onto the road. In front of us we see the houses of Seeshof. In the village you can admire a well house with a fire bell (5). Walk through the romantic village uphill to the right. At the edge of the forest, a field path begins on the right. With a wonderful view over the valley, to the Erthaler Berg and Buchberg, the path leads us back towards Hammelburg. First, the path slowly descends to the Rechbach stream. We enjoy a rest under an old lime tree (6) with a seating area. On the left bank of the stream and parallel to the road, we walk across the fields and reach Hammelburg. We follow the road \"An der Leite\" straight downhill. Then we walk under the railway tracks again and reach the roundabout. Here we find the Herrenmühle town museum, which vividly conveys the history of the region. The building with the baroque façade informs about the 1200-year history of wine in Hammelburg and bread making. We turn left into Bahnhofstraße and reach the market square again with its cafés and restaurants.",

            "description_long": "From the tourist information office, we walk uphill across the railway tracks and the Rieslochweg towards Scherau. Behind this part of town, the mixed forest with fir, beech, lime and rowan trees begins. In the undergrowth we see ferns and raspberry bushes. At a covered rest area, we continue up the slope. At a fork, we follow the sign with the white ten on a red circle. Here our path becomes a stony path. We cross the Schönebenenstraße and continue into the forest. The signs to the Silberberg summit show us the way. When we stop, we hear nothing but the sounds of nature. Finally we come out of the forest and stand on the Gottesgab plateau. From here we can already see the chairlift. There is a playground here for children, while we can rest a bit at the rest area. We finally walk a few minutes further and stand on the summit of the Silberberg. From the summit cross we look down on the village lying deep below us. The Silver Mountain got its name from the mineral galena, which was found here. The inhabitants of the region knew that they could extract silver from this ore. The ore was first mined by what is known as \"firesetting\". In this technique, the miners first heated the rock by fire and then cooled it by cold water. The rapid temperature change cracked the rock. Later, people drilled into the rock and split it with explosives. The silver obtained was used as a polishing agent and as an additive for dyes. The entire tunnel system in the mountain has a length of more than 20 km. In 1313, mining in Bodenmais was mentioned in a document for the first time, but it ceased in 1953. On the summit we can still see the traces of past mining. There are no longer any trees on the summit, they were felled a long time ago. The miners needed the wood to build tunnels and for firewood. We walk downhill again from the mountain summit and past the chairlift. At the edge of the forest, we follow the signs to Bodenmais and turn left. After a few 100 m we come to a fir tree with a stainless steel box. Here we can stamp the region's stamp in our hiking book. We pass the entrance to the summer toboggan run and shortly afterwards stand in front of the Bodenmais Mining Museum with the Barbara gallery. This historic mining facility is the tourist highlight of the community. We visit the exhibition rooms and the 500 m long gallery. We learn that more than 60 ores were mined in the Silberberg. In addition to galena, sulphur, chalcopyrite, zinc blende and bismuth could be mined. Even gold and platinum were mined. After visiting the museum, we stop at the miners' tavern and enjoy the view from the terrace. We walk downhill on Barbarastraße. This path is so wide that we can walk on the gravel next to the asphalt. On the right side, the summer toboggan run and the ski slope accompany us down into the valley. We come to the valley station of the chairlift. From here we walk downhill along the tarred road until we turn right into the forest after the bridge over the state road. We hike along narrow paths, cross two wooden bridges over the Zellbach stream and come to a Kneipp basin for treading water. After this break, we continue hiking and come out of the forest at the entrance to Bodenmais. The high residential street offers us another wide view over the town and the valley. Finally, we return via the rake path and cross the railway tracks to reach the starting point.",

            "description_long": "The municipal administration in Traitsching is our starting point. From here we cycle along the main road first in the direction of Siedling. The small, well-kept parish church stands on an island between two village streets. It gives us a first impression of the architectural style of the region. After a look inside the church, we first turn left and then immediately right again into Rissinger Straße. Here we cycle on a narrow road through the fields. Shortly before the village of Eichberg, we turn right and cycle down the hill. Soon the road climbs again and takes us into the forest. In the following clearing is the hamlet of Boden with an old farmhouse and its stables. We continue and come out of the forest at the sports grounds of Sattelpeilnstein. Now we cross the small crossroads and roll into the village. Here we first reach the castle of the village. It is privately owned and can only be visited from the outside. The mighty façade with its four towers is worth a look. Walking through the castle courtyard, we discover that a brewery used to operate here. A little further on in the village we find the parish church of St. Peter and Paul. We cycle out of Sattelpeilnstein and follow the road towards Sitzenberg. At first we can cycle downhill, but soon we have to struggle up the slope again. At the rest area \"Löwengrub\" we can rest a little. Then we continue through the forest towards Birnbrunn. On the heights, a road soon leads down to the village, but we continue straight ahead on a smaller road and enjoy the view of the mountains of the Bavarian Forest from up here. Now the road leads us in wide bends down to Tragenschwand. We pass the Geigenmühle, Hagendorf and the Seignhof and arrive at the busy main road. We cross it carefully and ride through the fields again in the direction of Kohhof. Behind Habersdorf we turn right before the B20 and cycle to Reisach. On this stretch there are several farms scattered in the landscape. At a crossroads there is a memorial stone commemorating the major land consolidation measures of the past 30 years. Over the centuries, the farms had become too small to be economically viable for their owners. After the measures of land redivision, more efficient farming is possible again. We drive into Sattelbogen and discover the parish church of St. Nikolaus dating from 1718. After a tour, we roll down the slope and pass a holiday village. On the way is the Sattelbogen open-air swimming pool, where we can refresh ourselves in summer. Here we turn off the road and cycle first in the direction of Mühlberg, before cycling about 2 km uphill to behind Obergoßzell. Behind Dinzling we let our bike roll downhill for a while. Then, however, it gets steep again. At the Giglberg farm, however, the biggest effort is already done before it is only a little uphill. After coming out of the forest, we ride downhill again with a view of our destination Traitsching. At the entrance to the village there is an old lime tree in front of the small chapel. This was only built in the 1980s, but the style of the structure is in keeping with the traditions of the region. Right next to it is a much older farm that is still being farmed. Finally, we cycle back to the starting point at the Traitsching municipal administration.",

Finally, we enter one of the quietest corners of the Allgäu Alps. On the way to the Rote Loch we pass the steep walls of Schneck and Gro&szlig Wilder. The Oytalhaus is a cosy place to stop for a bite to eat and drink right on the trail. The slopes on which we move are mainly north and east facing. We should therefore wait for stable conditions before undertaking this tour. The orientation along the Oy valley is easy. Above the Stuibenfall and from the Käseralpe, however, it can become a challenge in poor visibility and if there are no tracks.\r\n<p> </p>",

We are already on \"path no. 2\" here, which leads further up to the right at the next junction to the lookout point at the historic Wartturm. From there we have a wonderful view of the valley, the castle and the town of Weikersheim. At the Wart Tower, we choose the left of the three paths and thus enter the shady Winterberg forest. We follow the path that curves to the left through the forest and do not turn off it until we have left the forest again and see Weikersheim lying below us. Then we immediately turn left at the next junction and walk through the vineyards and along the road \"Am Schmecker\" back to our starting point. After the hike, it is a good idea to visit the beautiful Renaissance castle with its park and castle museum.\n<br/>The Weikersheim Castle, former ancestral seat of the Lords of Hohenlohe, is considered the most beautiful castle of this noble family.

            "description_long": "From the information board at the car park, we follow the signs for hiking trail \"W 9\" and its white-red-white markings uphill along Kramberger Weg. It soon leads us to the right into the Waffenschleifweg towards the sanatorium. At the first crossroads in the forest, we keep straight on and now hike very nicely through the dense forest. We cross a forest path and continue to walk half-right. When the path joins another one, we turn right. Now follows a wild-looking passage with large boulders at the edge of the path. For a short distance, we share the path with the educational trail on the history of settlement. On the clay pit path we reach the German-Czech border. At the border crossing, a covered rest area invites us to take a break. In winter, there is also an extensive cross-border network of cross-country ski trails here. From the border we first follow the white sign with the yellow direction symbol straight ahead in the direction of Odb. na Cerchov. The marking for the now following trail section consists of white-yellow-white bars. We soon pass a forest road. Shortly afterwards, we follow the markings to the left onto a short section of path. At the ruins of an old forest hut we come across a path, which we follow to the left. Cool, tasty water gushes from a spring at the ruin. From here we follow a new marking of white-green-white bars in the direction of Cerchov. The very beautiful forest path leads to a forest path, which we follow to the right. Shortly afterwards, we reach a T-junction and turn left. Soon after, the white-green-white marking leads us to the left onto a narrower forest path. From here, follow the markings to the right onto a path. There follows a short passage where we have to climb a few metres over a rock. If you want to save yourself this effort, you can skip the last turn. The path leads to a concrete slab path, which we follow to the right. Soon we reach the summit plateau of Cerchov. Dilapidated barracks bear witness to the former military use of this terrain. The high peaks near the border were used as listening posts on both sides of the Iron Curtain before the fall of the Wall. The lookout tower on Cerchov has existed since 1905, but for most of that time it did not serve its intended purpose, but was soon used by the German army of occupation and later by the Czechoslovak military. The small entrance fee is used to maintain the tower. From the top we enjoy a magnificent view in all directions. We can see especially far into the Bohemian plain. At the foot of the tower, a beautifully designed rest area invites us to take a break. We can stop at the Caffe Mila bistro. Monday is a day of rest. The actual summit of Cerchov, the highest mountain in the Upper Palatinate Forest, is easy to miss. It lies to the west of the lookout tower and is marked by a red and white pole. After our stay on the summit plateau, we hike back to Waldmünchen the way we came. Not far from the starting point, we can visit the Grenzland and Trenck Museum in the historic Schergenhaus. The exhibits, spread over three floors, vividly portray the town's history. One of the main themes is \"Trenck the Pandur\" who besieged Waldmünchen in the service of Empress Maria Theresa during the War of the Austrian Succession. This siege is also commemorated every year by the historic Trenck Festival in Waldmünchen. The other main topic, the location of the town of Waldmünchen on the national border, is more closely related to our hike.",

Shortly before Wiesen we meet the country road to Bad Orb again, which we cross to continue our way to Wiesen. After passing through the village, the climb becomes steeper and after another single trail and forest path, we reach the highest agricultural plateau in the Spessart. The settlement of Mosborn with its 80 inhabitants is on the same level. Here we are also in the meantime in the Hessian area\n<br/>of the Spessart. We continue our tour via a tarred connecting road. The first longer downhill is lightly gravelled but already firmly ridden in, so that once again high speeds can be reached, so be careful. At the bottom we meet the Laubersbach. To get to\n<br/>Habichtsthal, however, we still have to climb a smaller ascent. Via the subsequent descent we quickly reach the Aubachtal.

A tarred agricultural road slowly brings us up to altitude. The last section of the tour leads us back into the forest.

            "description_long": "Our starting point is at the cemetery in Bad Staffelstein, where we find sufficient parking space. First we follow the beautiful historic wooden sign \"Staffelberg\" and hike steadily uphill. We cross the \"A73\", the Frankenschnellweg, and walk on a gravel path through the beautiful meadows at the foot of the Staffelberg. Through a sunken path we finally reach the farm track, where we continue uphill before we reach the Staffelberg plateau. There, after the almost one-hour ascent, we have the opportunity to take a break in the Staffelberg-Klause, where we especially recommend the freshly roasted sausages or the \"white cheese\", or we can enjoy a contemplative stop in the Adelgundi Chapel, which was once a popular place of pilgrimage for the Franks. By the way: A hermit lived on the Staffelberg at the beginning of the 20th century! <br/>Now we should not miss the detour up to the Staffelberg rock. We hike along the circular plateau trail up to the summit cross, from where we have a wonderful panoramic view as far as Bamberg, the Grabfeldgau, the Thuringian Forest and Franconian Forest and, of course, the two monuments of Banz Monastery and Vierzehnheiligen. Bad Staffelstein's local mountain was also once a Celtic town: the Celts lived in two settlement rings, and numerous excavations and finds today bear witness to the former Celtic town of \"Menosgada\".\n<p> </p>\n<p>After visiting the \"Querkeleshöhle\" and learning about the legend of the cave from the information board, we start our descent. On the plateau we follow the sign to \"Horsdorf\" and walk downhill via the Karlsteig for about half an hour until we reach the pretty village, which has already won the national competition \"Unser Dorf soll schöner werden\". Here we also have the opportunity to stop at the \"Alte Mühle\". Now we have reached the Lautergrund, keep to the right along the village street lined with beautiful half-timbered houses and walk along the Lauter on a footpath and cycle path back to Bad Staffelstein. We pass under the Frankenschnellweg, the Hopfenmühle, before we walk right uphill after entering the town to the cemetery.</p>",

In the northwest, the more powerful mountain ranges of Hauchenberg and Sonneck-Grat border the hill country. To the east lies the Illertal valley. We pay attention to this, but not until the second part of the tour from Werdenstein. The castle of Werdenstein was the ancestral seat of the Lords of Werdenstein from around 1239. The chapel was consecrated in 1469. In the middle of the 17th century, the castle was sold to the Counts Köigsegg-Rothenfels. Since then, the building fabric has fallen into disrepair. It was not until 1988 that renovation work began, which enabled the entrance gate to be preserved in its present form. The world's largest horseshoe ever forged can also be found on the gate. It was forged in the castle courtyard on the night of the new millennium as a lucky charm, as can be read on a small plaque. A model of the former castle can be found in the photos for this tour. Afterwards we visit the Werdensteiner Moos, which is one of the largest raised bogs in the Upper Allgäu with an area of approx. 85 ha. After intensive peat cutting until the middle of the last century, numerous renaturation measures have been taken in recent years to protect the flora and fauna. This is how the moor was able to acquire the status of a European FFH protected area.",

The hike has only a few small ascents and therefore offers relaxed hiking with a mountain panorama.

            "description_long": "The \"In der Au\" car park on the Franconian Saale is the ideal starting point for many leisure activities around Bad Kissingen and the parking fee is kept within limits at one euro per day. We cycle from the car park in the direction of Luitpoldpark and pass the Schweizerhaussteg. After 100 m we find a cycle path marking on the right that points us to the right to Garitz. Here we turn off and reach Rosenstraße. We now cycle up the hill and past the Marbachtalklinik. We reach the agricultural office on the right and turn left here into Heinrich-Hack-Weg, which takes us back down. We ride through a subway and follow the cycle path markings, which point us to Albertshausen at the level of the cemetery in Garitz. Via Seehofstraße we thus reach the southern foothills of the Klauswald and turn left at Marbach into a forest path. The route continues to climb. Only at a crossroads in the forest, where we keep to the right, have we made the ascent. Now we cycle on a flat but winding track close to the main road. Now we can let our bike roll on a sloping stretch. We reach a very old, large oak (1) with a picture of a saint at the side of the path and then turn right over a bridge into Albertshausen. In the village we turn left, ride past the church on the left and out of the village. Through an avenue we reach the road to Oberthulba and we can already see the distinctive church building of the village from a distance. We cycle to the bridge, but before we reach it we turn right onto Schlimpfhofer Straße. However, we can take a first rest on the banks of the Thulba and let our feet dangle in the water for a while, because now a second longer ascent begins. We enter Schlimpfhof via a long right-hand bend, turn left at the main road and pass the village church. Then we turn right up to the sports field. Across open fields we reach Poppenroth. At the church we turn right and come to a crossroads where we find a cycle path marking pointing us to the left. We do not follow the main road, but turn into the road \"Männerholz\" beforehand. Behind the playground, we take a left turn towards the cemetery. We reach a plateau (2) where we have a wonderful view of the Kreuzberg and the route we have already covered. Here we have completed the long ascent for the time being and now cycle downhill again to Lauter. In Lauter we cycle uphill again towards the Edelweißhalle. Here, too, we have a beautiful distant view. We cycle out of the village and cross the main road at a model aerodrome (3). After 300 m, turn right onto a dirt road. On the left side in the valley is the beautiful Stralsbach with its high mountain church. We now follow the mountain bike markings to Bad Kissingen and turn right at a wayside shrine. We cycle through the forest and arrive at the Hermannsruhe forester's lodge (4) via a larger clearing. Here we turn right and reach a covered rest hut. Here we keep to the right again and cycle along the forest path that leads us over the main road. Now the long descent to Bad Kissingen gradually begins. Turn left at the next junction and continue straight ahead through the Klauswald forest. At a rest hut (5) we have another opportunity to take a break. Then we turn around a bend in the road and go straight downhill. All too soon we finally reach the car park \"In der Au\" again and have reached the destination of this circular tour through the Kissinger Rhön.",

As a rule, you ascend via the Mooslahneralm and the north-west ridge to the summit, which has some mighty snow cornices to the east - caution is advised here under certain circumstances. The formerly common ascent route via the Moosenalm and the entire northwest ridge is no longer justifiable for reasons of wildlife biology. Please follow the ski tour markings of the German Alpine Association. Orientation is usually easy, as the described route is often already tracked. If there are no tracks, the summit ridge covered in cornice can be difficult, especially in poor visibility. If you can, do not climb the Schafreuter at the weekend, as it is often relatively well frequented.\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

The entire lower section of the tour can be considered relatively safe due to the high proportion of forest. Overall, the tour runs mostly on north to north-west facing slopes. Since the Schönberg is frequently walked, there are often ascent tracks that make orientation easy. Without local knowledge and in poor visibility, only the upper area without existing tracks can be problematic.",

            "description_long": "<p>Constance became a bishop's see in 590 and was thus the first diocese in the German region. With its 10th century cathedral, Constance was a gathering place for many pilgrims from Swabia in the Middle Ages. The Way of St James from Constance to Einsiedeln is thus called the \"Swabian Way\". This section of the route takes us through the canton of Thurgau to the border at the Hörnli peak, where a mass camp, for example, offers inexpensive accommodation.<br/>The stage is not chosen to be too long, as Constance with the cathedral and St. Stephen's Church were already waypoints on the pilgrims' map, and the old town with many historic buildings is also worth seeing. In the eastern part of Kreuzlingen, the Augustinian canons' monastery awaits us. As soon as we set off, we come across the Holy Cross Chapel in Bernrain on the one hand and a magnificent view over Kreuzlingen and Constance to Lake Constance on the other. The route continues like this and anyone who looks around is glad that the stage is not longer.<br/>Shortly before the Hörnli, a crisp ascent of about 1 km on a footpath awaits us as the final bouquet, so that pushing the bike is unavoidable.<br/><br/><br/></p>",

Üvia Neuhus - Chalchtaren we hike to the Lämmlisgarten and the Iddaburg pilgrimage church, which stands on the site of the medieval Toggenburg, the ancestral castle of the Counts of Toggenburg. Idda, the wife of Diethelm IV of Toggenburg, lived here around the middle of the 12th century. According to historical sources, she was later, as a widow, an inclusress in the Fischingen monastery. A brochure about the legend of St. Idda is available in the church.<br/>We descend through the Burgwald forest to Hüttenstetten and reach the Murg on a steep road, which we follow to Fischingen - unfortunately on a tarred road.

The high points of the tour from Atzmännig to Steg are Tweralpspitz, Chümibarren and the highest Zurich mountain, the Schnebelhorn. <br/><br/>Corresponding to a tour including several mountains of 4000 m height in the Valais, we have the route from Atzmännig to Steg in the Töss valley. To be sure, they are at an altitude 3000 meters lower, and one does not need crampons or a rope. But the peaks called Schwammegg (1282 m), Rotstein (1285 m), Tweralpspitz (1332 m), Chrüzegg-Chümibarren (1314 m), Habrütispitz (1275 m), Rossegg (1254 m), Schindelberghöchi (1234 m), Schnebelhorn (1292 m), Hirzegg (1088 m) and Roten (1148 m) are also demanding. There are many drop-offs, and the commemorative crosses along the way remind one that fatal accidents are also possible here. The hike begins in Obere Atzmännig after a pleasant ride on the chairlift. Shortly after leaving the mountain terminus comes the first steep climb. Then one follows the ridge in the Rotstein direction. From there, one has a splendid view of the Toggenburg, Säntis and Churfirsten. One continues to the highest point on the route, the Tweralpspitz, and 20 minutes later one arrives at the Chrüzegg. The next descent passes through the mossy, dark fir forest to the Habrütispitz. From the Schindelberghöchi on one follows the border between St. Gallen and Zurich, and then comes the steep climb to the highest Zurich mountain.  In the Restaurant Tierhag below the Schnebelhorn one can enjoy some well-earned nourishment, and then there are only two peaks more. An autumn hike in the beech woods around the Hirzegg and the Roten is delightful. From Roten it is only a short distance to the Hulftegg «motorcycle pass». Gravel paths and tarred roads bring one to Steg, where the train takes one back to the lowlands.<br/><br/><strong>See also</strong><br/>Zürichsee Tourismus<br/>CH-8640 Rapperswil<br/>Tel: +41 (0)55 220 57 57<br/>E-Mail: zuerichsee@zuerich.com <br/>Internet: www.zuerich.com<br/><br/>",

The view of Lake Zurich, Glarus and Lake Constance is surprising. The mountain guesthouse was rebuilt in 1998.

At Jonenholz the Dietfurterbach is crossed one last time and after a somewhat steep ascent we reach the village of Libingen<br/><br/><strong>See also</strong><br/>St.Galler Wanderwege<br/>Toggenburgerstrasse 20<br/>CH-9652 Neu St.Johann<br/>Tel: +41 (0)71 994 29 11<br/>Fax: +41 (0)71 994 29 11<br/>E-Mail: <a href=\"mailto:info@sg-wanderwege.ch?subject=E-Mail\">info@sg-wanderwege.ch</a><br/>Internet: <a href=\"http://www.sg-wanderwege.ch\">www.sg-wanderwege.ch</a> <br/>Map material: <a href=\"http://www.sg-wanderwege.ch/\">www.sg-wanderwege.ch/</a><br/><br/></p>",

At the highest point of the hike, at the summit cross, you can once again enjoy the magnificent 360 degree panoramic view before starting the descent. After Chrüzeggspitz, the route leads about 50m through the forest, on the ridge towards Im Chabis. Once again, the view falls to the west into the depths.

The present monastery church was built in 1684-1687. The Idda Chapel attached to the north side commemorates the legendary life story of the Count Idda of Toggenburg.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>",

However, its most prominent citizen is the Toggenburg farmer and poet Ulrich Brägger (Näppis Ueli), who died in 1798.</p>\r\n<p><br/>We hike to Enetbrugg and über the Ratzenloch to the Iberg ruins. On the right is the Maria der Engel monastery from 1621, the best-preserved enclosure in the canton. Via Schlosswis - Schlossweid we reach Laad. The house with the two painted signs dates from 1641. Above Laad we leave the road and climb to Heid. From here the view sweeps from the Säntis über the Churfirsten to the Glärnisch. Slightly downhill via Hinterlaad to Bodenwis and along the road via Oberricken to the farming village of Walde with the sturdy St. Anthony's Church built in 1834. At the hamlet of Widen we turn off onto the road to Rüeterswil and cross the road at the St. Ursula Chapel built in 1810. Not far from the hamlet of Ruadheriswilare (Rüeterswil), the Sancti Galli capella, a chapel in honour of St. Gallus, which gave the village of St.Gallenkappel its name, was built in the Middle Ages. The Grubenmann Church, built in 1754, the cemetery chapel, consecrated in 1667, the rectory, a cubic baroque building, and the Wirtshaus zum Rössli, built in 1757, are worth seeing. Below the church, we take the meadow path to the hamlet of Geretingen and follow the path on the left side of the stream. Below us the deep ravine of the Goldinger Bach, on the left Mürtschenstock, Glarus Alps and Gross and Klein Aubrig. We hike to the wooden bridge built in 1830 ücke over the Goldinger Bach, down to the former mill and up to the renovated little church of Neuhaus. Then we branch off through the Risifeld to Bürstli to the Goldberg. On the Bürgitalstrasse we descend to the lakeside village of Schmerikon.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>",

Part of it is surrounded by city walls, behind which you can see the castle, the Elizabethine monastery and one of the churches. The castle was founded around 1260 by Přemysl Ottokar II as a royal castle. It was conquered during the Hussite wars, burnt down twice and converted into barracks under Maria Theresa. The castle was reconstructed at the beginning of the 19th century. The town fortifications also include two gates - the Saaz Gate and the Holy Gate (Žatecká brána and Mikulovická brána). The narrowest street in the Czech Republic leads from the Market Square (Mírové náměstí) to Sokolovská Street. At its narrowest point it is only 66.1 cm wide. To the west of it is the Franciscan monastery.\n<p>You can visit the Svatý kopeček (Holy Mountain) lookout tower above the town. It is located at an altitude of 390 m and is 16 m high. It is also worth visiting an unusually designed section of the shore named after the Czech animated film series \"Maxipes Fík\". Here, young and old alike can play to their heart's content.\n</p><p>After that, our route in Klášterec nad Ohří takes us through the beautiful English-style chateau park with many rare trees. But beware, cyclists must dismount there! The castle itself was built in the 16th century. Repeated fires led to reconstructions and changed the appearance of the castle. Today it presents itself in a classicist guise. There are three different tours for visitors - a porcelain tour, a fairytale tour and an exhibition tour. In the spa \"Evženie\", which lies directly on our route, you can fill up on mineral water from one of the local healing springs.</p>",

There we have the opportunity to stop at the Schlosswirtschaft Mariabrunn and enjoy a hearty Bavarian snack in the beer garden. Surrounded by historic buildings, we can linger at will. The place itself became a place of pilgrimage because of a spring that was said to have healing properties.

From the car park at the Kehlstein lift, we can set off on foot to the Kehlsteinhaus, accompanied by veritable crowds of tourists.However, the outstanding view of the Königssee with the Watzmann towering behind it, the Hochkalter and the Hoher Göll is well worth the short climb. Today's mountain inn and former Nazi headquarters is enthroned on a rocky outcrop like an eagle's nest. This earned it the nickname \"Eagle's Nest\". Finally, we continue by bike to the Rossfeld, where we are rewarded with another fantastic panorama after the steep and sweaty ascent. Finally, we return to the valley via an exciting trail that promises great downhill fun, especially for experienced riders.",

As the Brandenberg Alps to the south are lower, the summit offers excellent views of the Central Alps despite its relatively low altitude. But it is not only the Sonnwendjoch that is considered a scenic highlight of this tour, the nearby peaks such as the Bärenjoch or the Krenspitze also offer great views   As is usual for the Bavarian / Tyrolean Alps, physical well-being is provided for during the course of the tour. The cheese dairy in the Ackernalm is another historically and culturally interesting stop. The route character of the tour is mostly characterised by lonely mountain rides on good forest paths and leisurely rolling across meadows. Only a few uphill stretches challenge our leg muscles, but this is always rewarded with magnificent scenic views. With an altitude difference of 1250 metres and a distance of 24.1 km, this tour initially makes a more difficult impression than is actually the case, because as already mentioned, more leisurely sections dominate here.",

From the summit, the view extends over the Bavarian Pre-Alps, the Rofan Mountains, Wetterstein Mountains and Karwendel to the eastern Central Alps between the Stubai Alps and Hohe Tauern as well as to the Kaiser Mountains in the east. On this tour we want to go around this impressive mountain. In doing so, we will enjoy great gravel roads and long rolling rides. But also the landscape away from the Guffert knows how to inspire, the Filzmoos gorge, the canyons of Brandenberger and Steinberger Ache as well as the Rofandorf Steinberg are true highlights of the tour.

We continue towards Hirschbichl, passing a huge rockfall and enjoying the panoramic views. But the sometimes very steep uphill stretches take their toll on our strength. Behind the pass we continue uphill before we can recover briefly on a first descent. At Gasthof Lohfeyer, however, the next long ascent begins, at the end of which the idyllic Kallbrunnalm with the snack station of the same name awaits us. In a gentle up and down, we finally reach the Dießbachstausee. Here we are rewarded with an impressive view of the mighty rock faces of the Grosse Hundstod, which tower up on the opposite side of the lake.",

From the Lechbrücken there are wonderful views of the old town and the Mutterturm. The town also has a very special flair at night.

Von dort aus steigt ein steiniger Wiesenpfad kurz bergauf, geht dann aber relativ flach zuerst zur Edenalpe und danach weiter bis zur Ödenalpe. Zurück fahren wir den gleichen Weg bis zur Krinnenalpe, die nicht nur kulinarisch viel zu bieten hat, sondern auch mit ihrer großen Sonnenterrasse zu einer Einkehr einlädt. An der Krinnenalpe biegen wir dann nicht wieder auf den Meraner Steig ein, sondern auf den Forstweg, der schlussendlich zu Asphalt wird und vorbei am Kletterwald Tannheimer Tal wieder auf den Parkplatz führt. Diese Abfahrt bietet auch immer wieder kurze Trails, womit die Serpentinen abgekürzt werden können. Auf Wanderer muss dabei aber Rücksicht genommen werden.

In the sunny Burgberg im Allgäu, wine was apparently cultivated until 1855. As the name of the hillside north of the Knapp village makes clear. Unfortunately, nothing is known today about the quality of the wine produced. The wine no longer exists, but the name Weinberg has remained.<br/> Today, a very beautiful, short, sunny hike leads over this mountain, where you can enjoy wonderful views of the Illertal and the surrounding Allgäu mountains.",

Attractive sections alternate with passages that are easy to walk in order to keep the workload within reasonable limits and to close the circle. The tour can also be hiked throughout the winter, as long as the snow conditions permit. However, you should be aware that sections of the trail may be icy and therefore difficult to walk on.\r\n<p>First we hike along the route of the former Kempten - Isny railway line. Then we climb up to the Mariaberg and enjoy the beautiful view of the typical Allgäu landscape. At the halfway point we cross the Iller. We dive into the valley of the Leubas, feel the proximity of the motorway, leave Kempten Ost on the right and reach the Iller again shortly before the finish. Finally, we explore the Hermannstobel before taking the shortest route to our destination.</p>",

            "description_short": "The hike, which is very manageable in terms of time, offers beautiful views üover Lake Constance. We walk through picturesque parks and gardens, which are laid out between excellently maintained villas and the lakeshore. In Wasserburg, the castle awaits us with its fantastic location on the peninsula next to the church. At the end, Nonnenhorn offers a visit to an old wine cellar. If you do the trail in winter, you will be pleased to know that the B&Bs in Lindau and Wasserburg have opened their outdoor facilities for walkers during this time, which shortens the route slightly, but enriches it with more beautiful passages.",
            "description_long": "Lindau is a town with a very eventful history. Its special location on an island in Lake Constance contributes to this flux. Lindau has been particularly influenced by shipping, the salt trade and railway traffic over the last few centuries. The journey by train alone, over the embankment to the terminus, is an experience without equal in Europe. It is not comparable with a trip to the island of Sylt, as this is a lake. Leaving the station, it is only a few steps to the harbour, which has become famous all over the world for its harbour entrance, the lighthouse and the Bavarian lighthouse. A stroll through the city takes you past pretty town houses and numerous churches and towers. Maximilianstrasse is particularly worth a visit.\r\n<p>The Lindenhof Park in Bad Schachen and the Villa Lindenhof were laid out between 1842 and 1845. Today the entire area is owned by the town of Lindau. It is the largest park in the area of the Lindau villas. The Schweizerhaus, which was built in the 19th century as a servant's house, is also located there. It is particularly impressive with its many carvings on the balconies and facades.</p>\r\n<p>In Wasserburg, the peninsula offers a unique photo backdrop formed by the castle, a church and other buildings. Calendars often feature a view taken from the seaside. This is particularly possible from a ship. However, the jetty and a wide-angle lens are also very useful if you want to capture the scenery from the water side.\r\n</p><p>The Weintorkel in Nonnenhorn is an old wooden wine press dating from 1591 and has been a listed building for several decades. It is freely accessible and can be visited at any time. During the Christmas season, a nativity scene is set up in it.</p>",

We continue downhill (12%) to Gunzesried, turn right in the centre of the village and thus reach the Höhenweg, which takes us to Gunzesried-Säge. Now we have field paths and gravel underneath us instead of asphalt, but it is also easily doable for beginners. On the Rückweg we use the road, cycle over the Hohe Brücke and always downhill to Gunzesried, where we use the route via Halden and Bihlerdorf (more traffic) for the Rückweg or the route from the outward journey. On the way home, a stop at the Sennalpe Derb is then announced before we brake down the 15% gradient.",

Die Siedelalpe, ein beliebtes Ausflugsziel, ist bekannt für ihre urige Atmosphäre und köstliche Brotzeiten, die Wanderer zu einer Rast einladen. Der kurze Abstecher zur Jugetalpe lohnt sich, da man auf dem Weg herrliche Ausblicke auf die Allgäuer Alpen hat. Hier kann man die frische Bergluft genießen und ergattert sogar den ein oder anderen Blick auf den unten liegenden Aplsee.  Nach einem etwas steileren Abstieg erreicht man die Alpe Schönesreuth. Der letzte Abschnitt der Tour führt entlang der Alpsee Promenade zurück nach Bühl. Hier bietet es sich an, einen Sprung ins kühle Nass des Alpsees zu wagen. Der Alpsee ist zudem ein beliebtes Ziel für Wassersportler und Naturliebhaber. Der Weg Richtung Bahnhof folgt einem schönen Flusslauf.",

Like the Nagelfluh mountain range, the Immenstädter Horn consists largely of Nagelfluh rock. Nagelfluh is round rock that has been cemented with sand or lime under high pressure. Weathering creates the characteristic nail-head-like formations on the surface.<br/>In Bühl am Alpsee, we pass St. Stephen's Church and the pilgrimage church of Maria Loreto, a true-to-scale replica of the chapel in Ancona, Italy.<br/>We pass Bühl harbour and the large Alpsee lake on our way to the double castle of Rothenfels-Hugofels, which dates back to the 13th century.

Initially you will walk through some beautiful grasslands where there are benches to sit. After that you will cross the railway track. Just after walking a few minutes, you will see the lake of \"Grosser Alpsee\". Here you can rent a small boat or eat some delicious food. From now we are going towards the \"Vorder See\". You can play the game \"Memory\" on the way (See pictures). Here you can have a bath or have some fun with your kids. There is a Sportsclub nearby too where one can play Tennis. After this you will walk through a small tunnel and then reach the main road. After crossing the main road the hiking on the mountains starts. There are proper hiking ways for some distance but not all the way. One might feel, hopefully this road will bring us to an end too. Some small water falls can be seen too. From some points one can see the city. It is breathtaking. After about an hour of hiking, the way back will begin. It can be quite tricky at some point. All in all enjoy the trip :)",

The highlight of the tour is undoubtedly the ascent of the Hahntennjoch with its pass summit at a good 1900m and the subsequent descent. The ramps from Telfs up to Buchen are also quite an obstacle, with an average gradient of 9% over 7 km. But we are rewarded with numerous views of the Inn Valley.

            "description_long": "Our route starts in Ebensfeld, a town with 3,000 inhabitants, which lies at the southern entrance to the \"Gottesgarten am Obermain\". We start at the car park on the main road and immediately take the footpath and cycle path to the left of the road in a northerly direction until we reach the roundabout. There we take the path to the east and immediately find ourselves on a small land consolidation road up to the Veitsberg - always keeping our destination in mind. Our route is initially flat until we reach the motorway subway. Directly behind the subway we have the opportunity to take a short break at the \"Brünnla\", an enclosed spring. Now we face the first ascent to the hikers' car park at the Veitsberg, where we again have the opportunity to take a rest on one of the benches with a magnificent view. Now we hike uphill into the forest, soon leaving the asphalt path and reaching a path that leads steeply up to the Veitsberg. The ascent is extremely steep by Franconian standards, so we have well earned a rest on the Veitsberg plateau (don't forget to bring a snack!). Here, too, we find numerous benches with a wonderful view up to the Staffelberg and into the Main valley. We can also peek through a viewing window into the interior of the Veitsberg Chapel - the little church is very popular especially for weddings.\r\n<br/>Now we walk in a south-easterly direction downhill to Dittersbrunn, which we reach after passing the hikers' car park. In the village, we turn steeply left downhill into a small road that leads us almost directly to the Veitsberg inn, where we have the opportunity to stop for a break in a typical Franconian inn. After our rest, we follow the Flurbereinigungsweg downhill to Prächting, where we follow the Dittersbrunner Straße to the Prächtinger Hauptstraße. At the crossroads we walk 300 m to the right and have the opportunity to stop at the Landgasthof Hummel with a beautiful beer garden. Through a narrow path at the inn we get down to the Kelbach, where we keep to the right and always follow the course of the stream until we get back to the outskirts of Ebensfeld under the motorway bridge. Here we have the opportunity to take a detour to the left up to the Engelhardtskeller, a very idyllic beer garden, and continue straight ahead along the course of the stream to the main road, where we can take a detour to the left to Gasthof Neuner with its beer garden, continue straight ahead to the parish church Maria Verkündigung, which is well worth seeing, or turn right and walk 200 m back to the starting point.",

            "description_long": "From the car park in Bischofsheim, we head east out of the town on a slightly sloping route. The route markings are self-explanatory and show the next stage destination in each case. We first use the eastern route to Würzburger Haus and then choose the western route for the way back. The first village we pass on the cycle path is Unterweißenbrunn. At the end of the village, a tour marker points us to the Würzburger Haus. We cross the road here and reach a Marian altar (1) on the edge of the forest via a path. Here begins the first long ascent to the foot of the Kreuzberg. Crossing a long stretch of forest, we reach the Irenkreuz car park. On the opposite side of the road, an asphalt path leads us further up the mountain. At the Käulingsberg, the mountain stage becomes somewhat flatter for the first time and we reach the Neustädter Haus (2). Here we have earned our first rest. Then we cycle into the forest. Good technique is called for here, as we cycle over roots and stony ground. A crossing forest road forms the end of this ascent. We cycle along it to the left and thus round the southern slopes of the Kreuzberg. Now begins a longer descent on forest roads. After a bend to the left, we use a path for a short stretch. Slowly the view of the Black Mountains opens up through the forest and we reach the Guckas Pass (3) at the foot of the Kreuzberg. Here we turn left and after 10 m turn right into the forest path. We now cycle uphill again on a gravel path until we reach a forest road. Here we keep left, cycle past an abandoned basalt plant and reach an open meadow where a path begins. We then reach the Kissinger Hütte and enjoy the view of the Kreuzberg during a rest. The tour now leads us across a mountain meadow into the forest. We go downhill again for a longer stretch and reach a road, which we cross at the car park. Now we are in the Black Mountains. First we go up the Erlenberg, then along a longer stretch on level ground. We are now halfway through our tour and have reached the southernmost point of the tour. The view of the landscape here is of enchanting beauty and now another panoramic stretch lies ahead of us. We reach a fork in the road and take another right up the hill to the Würzburger Haus (4). Behind this, a small path leads into the forest, which soon meets a forest road. Follow this down to the road and cross it. We are now on the western route of the mountain bike markings. Smaller climbs follow again and again and via the Rhönclub hut and a forest climate station we reach the Guckaspass again. The last long ascent to the Kreuzberg follows, which we climb via the forest road on which we had already descended the mountain. We only bypass the section over the path this time and use the loop on the outside. At a junction shortly before the summit, we turn left and climb the last few metres to the Kreuzberg monastery (5). Here we have well deserved a longer rest and enjoy the atmosphere and the beautiful view. We finally use the road and rarely have to pedal, because from now on it's all downhill into the valley. Halfway down, we turn onto a path to the right. We pass the ski jumps and reach the village of Haselbach. On an asphalted road we thus reach Bischofsheim again and through the old town back to the central car park.",

            "description_long": "We start our cycling tour at the parish church in Blaibach. The castle opposite is worth a look at the beginning or end of this tour. Over the railway tracks and through the village of Kreuzbach, we first follow the R17 cycle path in the direction of Miltach and accompany the river Regen. In Miltach we cycle straight ahead along the main road and can take a detour to the castle. The landscape between Miltach and Krailing is characterised by many hedges dividing the agricultural plots. Behind Anzenberg we drive up the mountain to Heitzelsberg, where we can rest in an inn. We finally descend Zwierberg and turn right towards Allmannsdorf. At Birnbügel we can enjoy the unobstructed view across the landscape from a bench. We then continue on the narrow road until we reach a fork, where we turn off towards Altwies and Viechtafell. We reach Krailing and encounter the first cultural highlight of our tour. The outer façade of the parish church of St. Peter and Paul was renovated around the 18th century, but its core dates back to the Middle Ages. At the entrance of the church we find a peculiar shell stone with seven openings, in which the All Souls' lights used to be placed. We finally pass a large pasture in the middle of the village, where deer graze in summer. After we have rolled down the Krailinger Berg, another climb begins. It leads us through fields and forests. The climb is a little strenuous, but our eyes are pleased by the views of the landscape. The view from a rest area on the heights is particularly beautiful. A few metres further on, we roll down from the Ahrain estate through the forest to the Höllensteinsee dam. From the dam wall we overlook Lake Blaibach to the north and Lake Höllenstein to the south. In summer we can rent boats at this point. After an ascent to Gasthof Seeblick, we continue on a forest road to Ried am See and Hafenberg. Behind the climb we are rewarded for our efforts with a fantastic view into the Regental valley. After about 1 km we make a detour to the pilgrimage church in Weißenregen. The building was constructed in the 18th century in rococo style. Inside the church we admire the fisherman's pulpit from 1735, created by an artist from Bad Kötzting. Finally, we drive down the slope into Bad Kötzting. After crossing the bridge over the White Rain, we see the fortified church of the spa town. The centre of this fortified complex with its castle and fortified cemetery is the parish church. The castle was already the ancestral seat of the local ruling family in the 12th century. Now we cycle across the large car park of the town into the spa park \"Auwiesen\" of Bad Kötzting. We follow the river in the direction of Blaibach and pass the casino in the park. The cycle path runs along the river. We use an undercrossing of the state road and cycle up the short ascent. Then we stand on the dam wall of Blaibach Lake and look out over the wide blue. The cycle path then leads us further along the river until we reach the Blaibach campsite, where we can take a rest. Finally, we cycle over the two bridges of the Regen back into town to our starting point, the parish church in Blaibach.",

In the alpine pasture of the same name, the Moosen-Alm, we are offered simple food and drinks. Freshly fortified, we then start the challenging descent down to Schwarzbachwacht. The blocky trail requires excellent riding skills and the utmost concentration. Less experienced downhillers will have to push here, at least for the first part. But before the Haiderhof, riders of all skill levels get their money's worth once again.

On the left hand, the Grünten remains your companion for quite a while. After a short descent through the forest, the Berghofer Waldalpe appears on a hill on the right. After the alpine pasture, the next descent leads through the forest directly to the Starzlach river, where you say goodbye to the Grünten. The next part of the route is a forest resembling primeval forest until the asphalt road ends and you are now on a gravel road through coniferous forest. Ups and downs now determine the path to the Bildstöckle and you can look over until midday. The meadow just below the summit is the destination. With a wide view over the Oberstdorf mountains and the Kleinwalsertal valley. After the short descent, the path leads comfortably back to Immenstadt on the Iller dam.",

A dense and high-quality network of hiking trails and a varied, hilly landscape are optimal conditions for this. From this diversity, we have selected a range of suitable Nordic Walking routes for you, taking into account the scenic and sporting aspects. Come and join us for fantastic Nordic Walking tours - sönd willkomm!<br/><br/>This Nordic Walking tour of medium difficulty takes you from Speicher via the \"Eggen\" in the direction of Teufen to Waldegg. Enjoy the idyllic landscape on the ridge and the unique view of the Appenzell hills and Lake Constance. From Waldegg you continue down to the plain between Teufen and Speicher before the route climbs up the next hill, to the Hohe Buche.  From the Hohe Buche you \"walk\" to Trogen. Here, a visit to the Pestalozzi Children's Village Visitor Centre or a walk around the beautiful village square is recommended. The tour then leads back to Speicher.<br/><br/><strong>Note(s)</strong><br/>The Nordic Fitness Park Appenzellerland consists of seven Nordic Fitness Centres (Heiden, Walzenhausen, Speicher, Gais, Gonten, Urnäsch and Schwägalp). The individual centres are linked to each other by Nordic Walking connecting routes. The result is an area-wide network of around 350 kilometres of signposted Nordic Walking routes - a true paradise for every Nordic walker. <br/><br/>A Nordic Fitness Centre is a location that specialises in the needs of Nordic walkers. Each centre has three signposted Nordic Walking circuits of varying difficulty. There is at least one Nordic Fitness Hotel in the village, which has geared its services entirely to your needs. There is also a sports shop in the village (or nearby) that stocks Nordic Walking-specific articles and offers professional advice. Trained instructors are able to offer courses or accompany and look after you on request.<br/><br/>The starting point is the start and finish of the three local circuits and is marked by an information board which gives you useful information about the centre and the circuits. At the starting point, you can also book courses, rent poles and heart rate monitors, deposit your belongings and take a shower and change your clothes after the Nordic Walk.",

            "description_long": "Our tour begins with an enjoyable descent on the asphalt road down towards Nößling. We roll downhill to Oberhofen, at Reichsdorf we turn left into the village. At the information board, look out for the cycle path marking \"56\". From the end of the village, we continue downhill on an unpaved path along the edge of the forest. When you see the pumping station on the right, look out for the hiking trail markings \"11\" and \"3\" on the left at the next fork. At the Kneipp facility, we turn right towards Riedmühle. There we meet the through road to Viechtach. Before the prominent road bridge of the federal road, we follow the course of the cycle path \"36\" to the right. Our path leads steeply uphill, up to a section of the \"Pfahl\". The Pfahl is one of the most important geological natural monuments in Bavaria. This quartz reef stretches over 150 km, from Fürholz near Freyung in the Lower Bavarian Forest to Schwarzenfeld in the Upper Palatinate. We reach the residential houses and cross the road to Viechtach. On the opposite side of the road, we make a detour to the Catholic chapel of St. Anton. Our cycle path continues in an easterly direction. To the left we see the industrial estate of Viechtach and the Rehau factory, a manufacturer of technical plastics for the automotive and electrical industries, among others. We reach the outskirts of Viechtach, use the road on the left slightly downhill to the crossroads, turn right there and shortly afterwards left again onto the cycle path with the signpost \"54\". On the descent to the Schweinberger Bach stream we have to push part of the way, then we cross the stream at a Kneipp facility and after 100 m we meet the asphalt road that leads us uphill to Eging and on to Schweinberg. On the picturesquely situated road with little traffic, we look far out into the mountain landscape of the Bavarian Forest. After Leuthen and Zahrmühle we roll slightly downhill, then we have to climb uphill again on the wide but little-travelled road to Mehlbach and Hilb. When we reach Hilb, we first turn right to Gasthof Kraus, then left to the main road and there left again towards Achslach/Allersdorf. Our road now leads steadily uphill. In Einweging, instead of staying on the main road, we can also choose the path through the village with its pretty 19th century chapel. In Allersdorf we leave the main road and turn right. The Mater Dolorosa Filial Church was built between 1906 and 1908. The road leads us uphill past the Bielmeier inn in the direction of Bramersberg. However, 100 m before this part of the village, we turn left, following the signs to \"54\", towards Wetterstein. There are also beautiful views from here. Our route now leads steadily uphill. We stay on the asphalt road, which winds further uphill. A gravel path leads us through the forest for several kilometres. We finally reach the road to Sankt Englmar. Here we turn left and after about 300 m we see a large car park and the ski slopes of the Predigtstuhl on our left. At the next turn-off to the left, we take the side road leading parallel to Sankt Englmar and pass the Markbuchen mountain inn. Via the asphalted road we reach the first hotel facilities of Sankt Englmar. Here we cross the main road and keep to the right. We drive to the hikers' car park and continue uphill on a forest path into the forest. This section of the trail runs parallel to the Nordic Walking Tour \"7\", which is signposted. It leads via the \"Hochpröller\" inn to the Hinterwies car park, where we enjoy a wide view. From the car park, we pay attention to the signposted trail on the right, which leads us downhill into the forest and to our starting point. We end the day at the \"Zum Wurzlsepp\" inn.",

Finally, we cross the Galgenwurfsattel into the Isar valley, where the rugged rock faces of the Karwendel rise up on the other side of the valley. After a less beautiful section on the road, we continue in an impressive ride through the Johannistal up to the scenically unique plateau of the Kleiner Ahornboden. The partly extremely steep and rough trail demands a lot from us in terms of fitness. On the last ascent to the Hochalmsattel we have to mobilise the last of our strength before we reach today's destination, the Karwendelhaus, which is uniquely situated in the middle of the Karwendel and accordingly popular.",

Both for visitors to the Sky Walk platform next to the mountain station of the Dachstein glacier lift on the Hunerkogel and for the more extreme via ferrata climbers. Because anyone standing on the Sky Walk platform can see almost the entire upper part of the via ferrata through the window in the floor. The extremely exposed and difficult via ferrata leads upwards almost in the fall line of the Sky Walk platform. A total of 270 m of steel rope and about 60 step and grip bolts were used by the builders Prugger/Seebacher to create this bold via ferrata. The route itself runs along the south and south-east exposed wall of the Hunerkogel. Orientation is very easy, as for the greater part of the ascent you are literally tied to the path. The demands on strength and psyche are quite high, and there is no opportunity to take a break on the Skywalk via ferrata. It is therefore advisable to take a short webbing sling with a via ferrata carabiner with you to take some of the strain off your arms.",

With the Jagst river on our left, we walk along the Katzensteinsteige and the Mühlbergweg along the slope towards Bächlingen. We can make a detour to Bächlingen and look at the village church with frescoes from the 14th century and the Ark Bridge.

Together with numerous hikers, we enjoy the panoramic path towards the cable car station. This is the start of the exciting single trail to the rustic Hofbauernalm, some of which is a bit blocky and some of which is wonderfully flowing. A sophisticated riding technique and the best bike control are advantageous here. Maximum concentration is also required on the following long and steep descent through the deeply cut Klausgraben.

From the Rofanspitze, for example, you can marvel at the unique Karwendel panorama above Lake Achensee. Equally impressive is Lake Achensee, which is the largest lake in Tyrol with an area of 6.8 km². With its excellent water quality, the lake is an ideal sight and bathing place at the same time. It is all the nicer that we will be cycling the entire eastern shore of the lake. With 2400 metres in altitude and 72.5 km in length, the route facts of the tour not only sound challenging, but they are. Added to this is the fact that the bike has to be pushed again and again over a period of about 100 minutes. This means that this very difficult round is only suitable for trained riders.",

            "description_long": "We start our bike tour in front of the sports field in Stockheim and first cycle past the club grounds on the right and then in a loop on the field path back up to the road towards Willmars. The next 17 kilometres are characterised by regular climbs, but mostly on asphalt roads and interrupted by smaller descents. About halfway to the first stage town of Willmars, we reach a pony farm (1), which is the first attraction on the route for children. The route continues first uphill and then on a slight downhill slope into the village. We pass through it and now have to pedal harder again. A long climb brings us to the entrance of Filke. There we can turn right across a meadow and visit the remains of the \"Mauerschädel\" (2), an old wall that is the subject of many legends. We continue the tour on the road again and in the village we first turn left, then in the forest around a right-hand bend further up the mountain. After the top of the Büchelberg at an altitude of 502 metres, our tour becomes more moderate again and we reach the village of Weimarschmieden almost on level ground. We turn left into the village and can now treat ourselves to a longer break. The inn \"Zur Weimarschmiede\" has flair and continuous hot food. However, we should announce our visit a few hours in advance by telephone (09778/1605). We continue with fresh energy, not on the road, but again at the southern end of the village into a path. We cycle past a pond and shortly afterwards reach the road to Brüchs. Here we keep to the left and cycle uphill again. Shortly before reaching the village, we leave the road and cycle a loop through the fields to reach the first houses. Now the going gets tough. A signpost to Oberfladungen points us further up the mountain. The steepest part of the tour begins. We follow the markings and reach the highest point of our cycle tour at the beginning of the larger forest area (3) and are immediately rewarded for this stage goal with a wonderful, long descent that takes us into Oberfladungen. However, we should slow down at two hairpin bends, as the curves there are very sharp. In Oberfladungen, we cross the main road and leave the town via Mauergraben and Huflarer Weg in the direction of Leubach. Again we have to master a long uphill stretch before we reach the village. We cycle past the church and, after crossing the Leubach, turn into Rüdenschwindener Straße. This leads us out of the village and now longer stretches follow on a sloping road. In Rüdenschwinden we can take a bend through the village to have a closer look at the church. Back on the road, we enjoy the wonderful view downhill to Fladungen with the St. Gangolf's Chapel. We cycle on and reach the village of Hausen. Here we can take a break at a stone cross at the entrance to the village before continuing on the road down to Stetten. In the village, we cycle across the village square and turn right. A field path then takes us across fields and meadows to Urspringen. Continue along a cycle path at the entrance to the village to Sondheim. We turn right onto a road and cycle past the Protestant church (4) out of the village again. Now follows the last longer ascent of our cycle tour. We have to pedal hard again over the foothills of the Heidelberg before we reach Ostheim. We leave the road before the level crossing and cycle along the river Streu into the centre of the village. We should not miss a visit to Ostheim's fortified church (5) on our tour. After this welcome change, we cycle on to the end of the village and use the cycle path, which then brings us back to the sports grounds in Stockheim, where our excursion ends.",

Beginners and less fit riders should not be put off by the relatively short tour length of 22.2 km. Several challenging climbs push the difficulty level upwards. As a reward, we will pass six inns in the course of this tour, so that no biker will have to end the tour hungry or thirsty.",

The circuit of the Gosaukamm can be done as an extended day tour as well as a leisurely 2-day tour. <br/> <br/> However, opinions differ on the direction of the walk: is it better to walk counter-clockwise or clockwise?                  Either way, this tour is always beautiful.  You should consider the position of the sun when choosing the walking direction, because comfortable walking is possible at high temperatures on the north side - the south (east) side, however, becomes a sauna at summer temperatures! <br/> <br/> Most people start this tour at the large car park of the Gosaukammbahn in Gosau-Hinterthal. From there, many also decide to walk in a clockwise direction - i.e. first northwards towards the Hofpürglhütte. This section of the trail is one of the most impressive parts of the hike: absolute silence, huge rock faces and a super view (e.g. Dachstein,...).",

This leads us up the hill. We immediately come across the first cycle path marking, which points us towards Kronungen. We follow it and reach the first small peak at a turn-off to the left, which we follow. Now the path goes slightly downhill again on asphalt over meadows and we cycle south past the cooper's well. The Leuselbach accompanies us first to the left, then to the right on our way to Poppenhausen. We turn right into a path after a left-hand bend. At the railway subway before Kronungen, we keep to the right and reach the town's sports facilities on a level path. Here we cycle uphill again a little and follow the cycle path markings on the field path. These lead us first left, then right and after 500 m left again over the small hill down to the road. We reach the road at a wayside shrine and enter Kützberg. The parish church of St. Michael (1) appears in front of us. We pass it on the right and soon find a signpost pointing us to Ramsthal. We leave Kützberg via Sulzthaler Straße and cycle steadily uphill again. At Goldgraben we change to a field path and cycle across fields and meadows into the forest. We cycle uphill through a beech forest for a while, but are then rewarded with a beautiful descent to a clearing. Then there is another ascent on asphalt that brings us to a crossroads with a wayside shrine. We turn right here and climb the hill to the hermit's farm. After a left turn we reach a crossroads, follow the signpost to Ramsthal and reach a bench with an information board about the cycle paths in the region. In front of us is the so-called Knückelein (2), at 384 metres above sea level a beautiful vantage point and an ideal place to rest. After this detour, we return to the trail and continue towards Ramsthal. We now have a long descent ahead of us, which takes us into the wine-growing areas of the administrative community of Euerdorf. We reach the main road via a long right-hand bend and turn left here. We cycle through Ramsthal and then use the cycle path. This leads us past the foot of the vineyards to a crossroads. We turn right and now have the last crisp climb ahead of us. At a wayside shrine (3) we change to the road, cycle through Wirmsthal and reach a junction at a right-hand bend with a crucifix. We turn left here and now pedal hard. Finally we reach a road and follow it to the left to the Wittelsbacher Turm (4). From it we can overlook the entire surrounding area and we should not miss this view after a short rest. Right next to the lookout tower we can now stop at the adventure brewery and recover from our efforts. Back we go on the road past the landfill. At a crossroads we turn left. We follow a signpost to Oerlenbach after 500 m to the right and reach the village across an open field. We cycle past the training centre of the Federal Border Guard and then turn right onto Ebenhäuser Straße. We reach Ebenhausen via a cycle path and turn right at the railway station. We pass the playground (5) and reach our car park again via the village square with the church. The inn \"Zum Hirschen\" is a good place to stop for a rest at the end of the tour.",

            "description_long": "In the Franconian three-river town of Gemünden, the Sinn and Franconian Saale rivers join before flowing into the Main. The historic old town with its buildings in red sandstone, its nice shopping arcade and the ruins of Scherenburg Castle are just as worth seeing as the Hutten Castle, where the tourist office is located. From the old town we cycle to the car park \"Lindenwiese\" and towards the campsite. We cross the Saale and follow the signs of the Sinntalradweg along the course of the Sinn upstream. The Sinn valley is one of the few near-natural river valleys in Germany. Various information boards will point out special features of the Sinngrund. We pass the fishing lakes and the meadows where the highly endangered chess flowers bloom in April and early May. We cycle a short distance parallel to the railway line, then under it to Schaippach (1). We cross the old bridge with the bridge saint and immediately turn right. We cycle parallel to the railway line through the valley towards Rieneck. We cross the railway line and shortly afterwards the Sinn to cycle past the sports grounds via the \"Untere Jägerwiese\". A detour to the small town of Rieneck is recommended. The town's 1200-year history is still alive in some of its buildings: old half-timbered houses, the town hall and the Historic House (2). The Counts of Rieneck built a castle here in 1170, thus establishing their ancestral seat. The adjoining Romanesque chapel is unique in its construction. From the heights there are charming views of the Sinngrund and the wooded slopes. Then we return to the junction from the cycle path and cycle through the wide, level valley with a view of the castle. The path follows the left bank of the Sinn. Behind a bend, we cycle parallel to the country road for a short distance, then cycle alongside the Sinn and the railway line again. Finally, a right-hand bend leads us uphill, over the railway line and left again in a northerly direction. The ride continues between fruit trees to Burgsinn, the largest community in the Sinngrund. We pass the open-air swimming pool (3) and reach the centre of the market with the nice ice cream parlour at the town hall on the bridge over the Aura. We follow the main road in the direction of Mittelsinn, round the park with the old moated castle (4) and turn into Poststraße. Here we cross the Sinn again and follow the cycle path signs. The path runs parallel to the railway line to Mittelsinn. The village, founded in 1275, has been able to maintain its traditional rural structure up to the present day. The parish church of St. Jacobus (5) is worth seeing, with parts of the building dating back to the 14th century. Behind Obersinn, the cycle path leads over Dickenmühle and through a wooded area with the idyllic meandering Sinn. Crossing the bridge, we find a nice little shop and a country inn. We continue cycling on the left side of the river towards Bad Brückenau, pass the sports field and turn right at the edge of the forest. The section to Jossa is particularly beautiful. We cycle up and down a gravel path through a forest with tall trees and above the Sinn. Then the view opens up to us of an old railway viaduct and the modern ICE line. We pass under the bridge and again on asphalt along the idyllic river bank past the Dittenbrunn farms. We continue cycling until our route branches off to the left into the Altenauer Seewiesen nature reserve (6). The section through the floodplain landscape is a delight. We cross the Sinn over a wooden bridge, pass under the railway viaduct and reach the beautiful meadowland of Jossa. We cycle around this on Spessartstraße with its pretty houses and continue on Würzburger Straße. We end our tour at Jossa railway station. We return with our bikes by train to Gemünden.",

            "description_long": "We start our tour in front of the tourist information office, opposite is the valley station of the Jungholz lift, and drive to the Maria Namen church. At the church, we turn right, up to the district of Langenschwand and cross the village on the asphalted main road. When the road turns left after about 400 m, we keep straight on (signposted \"Pfronten-Ried 7 km\") and come to an unpaved, wide path. Let's not forget to enjoy the view during the rapid descent! Shortly afterwards, the trail descends in steep serpentines to the Scheidbach stream. The only indication that we are crossing the border is a red and white barrier and an inconspicuous sign \"Landesgrenze\". Behind this sign, we follow the wide path to the right, always further down to the valley of the Vils. When we leave the forest, the valley opens up and gives a view to the south of the Kühgundkopf and Iseler. We follow the path down into the valley, at the Vils we turn right towards \"Rehbach\". Now the wide path winds up the valley right next to the Vils (signposted \"Rehbach R3 1½ h\"). On the left we see the rock face of the Feuerschrofen. If we drive along here in the late afternoon, we understand the name, because then the red evening light bathes the imposing rock massif in fiery red light. We always stay on the path to the right of the Vils. Again, almost unnoticed, we leave the German border behind us, the Kälberhof-Alpe already belongs to Austria again. We pass the barriers for the cattle and cross the Vils over a concrete bridge behind the house, cross a beautiful meadow and meet a signpost at its end. We look out for the signpost \"Rehbach\" with a red cross, turn right and 100 m beyond that turn left into the forest (marking: red dot). At the next fork, there are four directions to choose from. Hidden behind a spruce we find the signpost \"Rehbach\". Behind the two steel bridges, the path now goes so steeply uphill that most bikers have to push. At the top, at the \"Alpenrose\" inn, there is a good opportunity to take a break. If you don't want to take a break, ride past the inn onto the asphalted road, where you come out of the forest behind the bend and reach an information board and a signpost. Unterjoch/Zehrweiler\" is marked on the right. Once again we have to push our bikes. But only for a short distance, then it's downhill again, towards an asphalt road. A descent to enjoy: We cycle on the asphalt to Unterjoch, directly to the church in the village. There we turn right, following the signs to the \"Vordere Sorgalpe ¾ h\" along the little stream. We cycle through the wide valley of the Wertach, first on a wide dirt road, then on a path. We cross small bridges again and again, orientating ourselves by the signs \"Vordere Sorgalpe\". Then we come to an asphalted path that leads us to the Sorg-Alpe. We go around it on the left. Now we go uphill on forest paths to Jungholz (blue rectangle). We reach the first houses of Jungholz. On the main road we get directly to our starting point of the tour.\n<p> </p>",

            "description_long": "From the railway station in Spiegelau, we keep to the right along the tracks and drive along the station road to the Kurpark entrance (1). The almost seven-hectare park invites you to linger with three lakes and wide open spaces. We follow the Trosselweg to the right out of the village. We overcome a small ascent and pass the forest playground (2), which is accessed by a nature adventure trail. Here you will find a swing, a footpath and a barbecue area. Go uphill under the shade of the trees and then continue to the right. Wild horsetail thrives here near the marker ditch (3). The plant belongs to the ferns and is found preferably on damp ground or directly in the water. We now follow the asphalted forest road into the Hammerwald and past the northern flank of the Hohe Scheitstatt. Now we head north on a winding route. At the Hüttenbach our path joins up with another road. We continue straight ahead for a short distance and take the next fork to the right. The road now becomes visibly thinner and is only lined by a few rows of trees. We continue to the left along the Hüttenau hillside and see forest stands that are marked by bark infestation, but are now in the recovery phase. Now follows a slight depression in which we cross some smaller riverbeds. Our route soon describes a right turn until we turn left onto a path that takes us to the small Rachelsee. On the way, information boards explain the (partly still visible) effects of the last ice age. At the end of the small body of water is the Rachel service hut (4). The former forester's lodge now offers a rustic place to stop for refreshments, which can also be reached by the so-called „Igelbus“ and is used as a starting point for hikes to the Great Rachel or the Rachelsee Chapel. We then continue through a maple and spruce forest. Soon we follow the course of the Tiefen Steige and then cycle at the foot of the Taferlruck mountain to a wayside cross. Here we keep to the right and return to the route already known from the outward journey. This leads us back to Spiegelau, where we started our tour.",

Shortly afterwards, the first metres of ascent follow in the direction of Dörrmorsbach.\n<br/>A short trail provides some variety in between before we arrive at Dörrmorsbach on the last stretch of the connecting road. From here, the route now becomes steeper on good forest paths in the direction of Pfaffenberg (BR radio tower) and on a high trail in the direction of Hohe Warte. Directly at the Hohe Warte, we turn right onto a beautiful trail that takes us towards Volkersbrunn. After crossing the main road at the entrance to Volkersbrunn, we continue on forest and partly rooty trail passages towards Eichelsbach. From Eichelsbach, asphalted farm tracks lead us rapidly down to Eschau. In Eschau we ride along the main road for a short distance to get to the opposite side of the slope. A little later, short combinations of paths with different surfaces take us up to Wildenstein. This is also where the final ascent to Geißhöhe begins. The Ludwig Keller tower on the Geißhöhe has to be climbed, of course, to enjoy the view from up there. A little later we descend via a longer trail directly to Dammbach, where we can enjoy the view from the top.\n<br/>we approach the entry point to the Heimathenhof climb. Following the further course of the trail, we meet up with our outward route and take a <br/>short stretch to the right at Volkersbrunn.\n<br/>shortly downhill to the right on the main road until the bend, where a short trail section brings us to the Kapellenberg. The trail then continues slightly uphill and a short descent brings us to the sports field of Mespelbrunn. On the then asphalted connecting road we ride to the hairpin bend in Langer Grund. Here the ascent to the Hohe Warte begins. From the Hohen Warte we ride similar to the outward route, but this time around the radio tower to the right on a narrow trail section. On beautiful trail combinations we reach the sports field of Dörrmorsbach. From here we ride down through the village towards Bessenbach on a side road that is hardly used. In Bessenbach we cross the federal road B8 and now start the last climb of the day. At first it is still asphalted, but later it is on trails and gravel paths. At the top of the hill we meet\n<br/>again on our cycle path, which takes us the last few metres to the starting point of the tour.",

            "description_long": "We start at the car park in the direction of Markbuchen, until after about 100 m we turn right uphill along Hirschensteinweg. At the signpost \"Rundweg Predigtstuhl\" we go left on the path at the edge of the forest to the last house. There we keep to the right and walk on the slightly ascending path to the valley station of the chairlift. There we leave the path and climb up the mountain via the western ski slope to the Predigtstuhl. With good visibility, we enjoy a wider and wider view with every metre of the ascent. Between the two chair lifts there is a strip of trees, to the right of this stand of trees our path leads up to the summit cross of the Predigtstuhl. From now on, we follow the signs \"Hirschenstein\" and a green arrow. At a refuge, we meet a wide path that takes us straight ahead on the high plateau of the Predigtstuhl without strong ups and downs for several kilometres to Oedwies. A clearing stretches around the abandoned Oedwies forester's lodge. The Bavarian Ministry of Forestry operates a forest climate station here, which regularly takes extensive measurements of climate values and also records, among other things, the input of pollutants and nutrients. It is one of 22 state measuring stations whose data are intended to contribute to a better understanding of the forest ecosystem. Oedwies is said to have been cleared for the first time as early as 1559, as attested by an old Viechtach document. However, the wasteland was mainly used as grassland. The rural estate was replaced in the mid-19th century by a state forestry house, which also ran a small inn for the forestry workers. The living quarters of the forester's family were only on the upper floor because of the often high snow cover. We continue to follow the signposting \"Hirschenstein\". Our path leads slightly uphill to Hirschenstein, 1 km away. Here we can take a rest at the tables and benches. Of course, we pay attention to the small lookout tower. On a clear day, it allows us a wide view of the Bavarian Forest landscape. The view stretches from the Großer Arber to the Dreisessel in the east, the region from Deggendorf to Straubing in the south and as far as the Gallner in the west. On a few days a year, the view is said to reach as far as the Alps - even the Zugspitze can be made out then. The lookout tower was built in 1921 by the Bavarian Forest Section Munich and renovated in 1995. We descend on the south side of the Hirschenstein on a path towards Schuhfleck. At this hiking trail junction, eight trails from all directions meet. Here we follow the signs \"Rettenbach\". After a while, we pay attention to the marking \"8\", which accompanies us to Loderwinkl. There the path becomes an asphalted road and we continue downhill to Rettenbach. We cross the resort until we reach the town exit sign and here we turn right into the Hans-Sachs-Weg, slightly ascending towards the forest. From this road there are beautiful views northwards into the valley of the Englmarbach and of Sankt Englmar. We follow the signs \"5\" through the forest to Glashütt. Here we pay attention to the turnaround loop of the bus stop at the Schullandheim and walk uphill on the right along the access road. After about 300 m we meet the \"Waldcafé\" and continue uphill along the slope until we meet new signposts. We orient ourselves in the direction of \"Markbuchen\" for the last few metres and walk above Sankt Englmar along wide hiking trails to an information board on an asphalt path. Downhill we reach our starting point.",

The \"Johann\" is a very long, strenuous and varied via ferrata. The key section is right at the beginning of the entry (E): a slope has to be climbed. The route to the entrance also requires full concentration, because there is often old snow here and climbing sections up to I (UIAA) have to be overcome. It may be advisable to bring light crampons and an ice axe. The route runs along the south-facing exposed face of the Hohe Dachstein. Orientation is easy up to the top of the wall, but the approach to the start is only marked in places. In poor visibility, finding the mountain station from the Seetalerhütte can be a challenge. The protection on the Johann via ferrata itself is impeccable. 700 m of wire rope and 250 step pins make the \"Johann\" a via ferrata highlight for very skilled via ferrata walkers. Strength, endurance and a head for heights are prerequisites for the \"Johann\".

The ascent is very steep in places, so a solid ascent technique is a prerequisite. The descents are all quite steep and, depending on which route you choose, have a westerly, southerly or easterly exposure. This and the steepness of the slopes require stable conditions for our tour! There is also the danger of snow cornices on the summit ridge. Orientation is initially very easy, but from the saddle between the Hoher Fricken and the Wank it can become a challenge in poor visibility and if there are no tracks. The Esterbergalm is a cosy place to stop for a bite to eat on the descent.\n<p> </p>",

At that time, Füssen was located on the Via Claudia Augusta Roman road. The small old town centre with its many pretty houses, the churches and the town castle are well worth a leisurely stroll. The proximity to the royal castles and the numerous spa facilities still attract many holidaymakers. Last but not least, the surrounding, very charming landscape leaves unforgettable impressions.</p>\n<p>On the site of today's castle, there was once an ancient Roman fort and then a castle. Around 1500, it was transformed into a castle. The paintings on the façades in the inner courtyard are particularly worth seeing.</p>\n<p>The Baumgarten town park belonged to the monastery of St. Mang from the 14th century. Around 1900, the grounds were acquired by the city of Füssen and transformed into a public park. A special feature is the old water reservoir. It was built in the shape of a castle with a tower and battlements. Many rows of lime trees line the paths.</p>\n<p>The Alatsee gained renewed fame when it became the setting in a detective novel about the inspector Kluftinger. Its special location, framed by gentle wooded hills, is popular with hikers, bikers and swimmers alike.</p>\n<p>The location of Falkenstein Castle is very exposed and therefore particularly vulnerable to storms and lightning strikes. Therefore, it was decided to build a simple robust multi-storey house with a gable roof. In 1884, King Ludwig II acquired the site and wanted to have a robber baron's castle built there. However, his bold ideas never got beyond the planning stage. The original model can now be seen in Neuschwanstein Castle. Further information can also be found in a small museum room at the castle hotel.</p>\n<p>The Marian Grotto below the Falkenstein castle ruins is dedicated to the veneration of Our Lady of Lourdes.</p>",

Behind a bend, we disregard a first small turn-off and turn right at the next one in the direction of Rohrkopfhütte. Through the dense wintry forest we climb up a steep mountain slope. To our right, a view opens up through the trees towards the valley station of the Tegelberg cable car. We continue along the path for a while and finally come to the place where a landslide occurred a few years ago, when a large part of the north-western flank slid down into the valley. An information board tells us exactly what happened. From here we can see the two royal castles of Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau in the distance.\n<p> </p>\n<p>Now we continued our ascent in the direction of the Rohrkopfhütte and reached it a little later. It is located directly on the downhill slope of the Tegelberg and invites you to a cosy stop.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We leave the hut behind us and set off on the descent to the Drehhütte, which starts to the left of the ski slope. (The path can be closed in winter for weather reasons, please follow the signs!) We quickly reach the hut (currently not managed) via two hairpin bends and can take a break. Where the hut stands today, there were once two huts where whetstone makers lived. They worked the dark grey stones in the nearby quarry. Later, the huts were used by alpine herdsmen, before finally the currently unmanaged Drehhütte was built.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Our way back leads us along the forest road back to the starting point.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Alpine dangers!

            "description_long": "From the war memorial we drive between the inn and a very old wooden house to the castle and are met by an open gate to the inner courtyard with a church worth seeing. Ranfels Castle was built around 800 and even today you get a good impression of the complex. To the right of the entrance, next to the information board, a narrow path begins, the \"Burgrundweg\". At the first junction we turn right, pass a playground and continue along the cliff edge until the path widens and leads us downhill onto a road. We follow this for a few metres, finally a path branches off to the left again (hiking trail \"63\"), which leads us to Unterranfels. In the village, we turn left onto an asphalt road, then we turn right over a stream bridge. We choose the path on the right, to the \"Kneippanlage\". Now we head south on forest paths for a long, idyllic stretch along the Große Ohe. After about 1 km the path becomes asphalted and steeper. Finally we reach the edge of the forest, pass the Kneipp facility and reach the road near Kneisting. We turn left and after about 40 metres turn right onto a field path. We follow this until the path joins a road. We drive to the through road and turn right onto it. Then we turn off to \"Altfaltern\" and cycle across the fields to a T-junction. We follow the road to the left to Altfaltern and then straight on along the edge of the village. At the asphalt end, we continue straight ahead on the gravel path to the fork in the road. Here we turn right and cycle to a cross path. This leads us uphill to the left into the forest. Turn right at the first fork, then straight on uphill, straight on uphill at the next fork and right at the next fork. This path leads around the hillside to the right. At the bend in the path, we go down to the left into a hollow. There we follow the forest road on the right uphill for about 500 m until we reach a forest road. Turn left and cycle uphill to Gschwendt. We pass the estate and cycle on a concrete road through an avenue of birch trees. At the junction we turn left on the likewise concrete road until we reach a barrier. Shortly afterwards, a gravel path leads to the left to Ochsenstiegl (4), the highest point of the tour. From the lookout tower we have an excellent view over the Dreiburgenland, to the mountains of the Bavarian Forest and with luck to the Alps. Back on the road, we follow it briskly downhill to Thurmansbang (5) and the cobbled village centre with church. We pass the tourist information office and now always follow the \"Mühlenweg 60\". We cycle downhill and past several ponds, then we turn left to the through road. We cross this and shortly afterwards follow the hiking trail \"60\" to the right along the edge of the forest to another road. We cross this and arrive at the \"Ginghartinger Mühle\". The mill is a listed building. The water wheel is still partly in operation. The path leads through the estate (please dismount!). At the next junction we turn left and now follow a beautiful stretch along the meandering Ginghartinger Bach stream until we reach a road again. Turn right onto this road and ride steeply up to Lindberg and then left to Hauermühle. Shortly afterwards we pass Neuhof and further uphill the café of the same name. After 300 m, a forest road branches off to the left behind a shed and soon turns into a meadow area. There we keep straight on twice and then roll left downhill to Ranfelsmühle. We take the road on the left and turn right before the bus stop, passing an estate. Once again we go through the romantic Ohe valley. At the junction we ride back over the bridge to Unterranfels. We turn right onto the road and in a final climb we return to Ranfels.",

            "description_long": "From the Haus des Gastes we walk downhill and turn right onto the main road behind the hospital. At the police station, we go down the narrow tarred path on the right and turn into the road called \"Waldweg\". We reach a path on the left that leads us directly into the forest. Here the Heindlmühle inn is already advertised. After a short hike, we emerge from the forest and see the inn ahead of us. We pass a ski lift (1) and follow the sign to the right to the Seeweg. We hike close to the Austrian border. At a bridge we turn left onto a narrow tarred path. Behind the stone mill is a barn with many old agricultural tools and machines attached to its façade - almost a museum! We continue up the slope and into the forest. After passing through the villages of Fronau and Monigottsöd, we cross a field path and come to the Osterbach, which marks the border to Austria. This is where the landscape conservation area of the \"Eidenberger Lusen\" begins. We first hike at the foot of the mountain into the forest. This part is called \"Bärenloch\". On an information board at a resting place we read the reason: Brown bears were still native to this forest area in the century before last. The forest was declared a protected area when plans were made to build a large hydroelectric power station here. We follow the stream on the forest path to a shelter (2) with a picnic area. After a break, we continue along the stream. We pass an information board that tells us about the old sawmill on the Osterbach. Farmers in the region used the water's gradient to process wood. In the spring of 1944, huge masses of snow destroyed the mill. At the edge of the forest there are works of art made of old agricultural implements. We first walk to the village of Eidenberg before deciding whether to venture the detour to the Lusen summit. The climb to the summit would extend our hike by two hours. Finally, we hike out of Eidenberg and follow the river Ranna. Before reaching the outskirts of Maierhof, we go uphill for a bit, then a sign points us down to the Rannasee (4). It is the largest bathing lake in the Bavarian Forest. On the shore of the lake, the restaurant \"Zur Wasserrutsche\" with a large playground invites us to linger. The southern shore is already in Austria. We then carefully cross the main road and enter the forest. Behind the Stierbach stream, after a bend, we reach the old dam of the rack railway (5). The not too dense trees let us look far into the mixed forest on both sides. We pass the Stiermühle on the left and continue hiking until we reach the entrance to Niederwegscheid. There we turn left and follow the signs at the edge of the forest. We can rest at a resting place under trees. The path leads to a farm. There we turn right and walk the last stretch to Wegscheid along a narrow tarred road. We hike into the village and decide to visit the parish church (6). The former neo-Gothic church on this site was demolished in 1967 and a modern church built in its place. The tranquil interior is worth a look. The square ground plan is surmounted by a roof whose four pointed gables form a uniform cross. The light penetrates through the stained glass windows on the gable walls and bathes the room in warm colours. After the visit, we walk back to the starting point via the main street of Wegscheid with its restaurants.",

            "description_long": "Our bike tour starts in the tranquil national park community of Sankt Oswald. From the parking bay opposite the hotel \"Residenz\" just before the cemetery we cycle uphill to the school. The road ends and turns into a gravel path, which in turn ends at a road onto which we turn left. A magnificent view of the Rachel-Lusen panorama accompanies us on the ride through the village of Totenmann and on to Höhenbrunn. <br/><br/>The next National Park community we pass through is Reichenberg - with a scenic location on a mountain ridge. We pass a bike park and several places to stop at the village square. Finally, we turn right into the mountain road towards Riedlhütte. The \"Pilz-Wanderweg\" (mushroom hiking trail) now shows us the way to the Racheldiensthütte. Some interesting signs of the historical themed hiking trail \"St. Oswald-Riedelhütte\" are along the way. At the edge of Riedlhütte, we cross the Gro&szlig Ohe on a covered wooden footbridge, following the cycle path \"92\". Turn left into Pocherstra&szlig and after the chapel turn right into Hammerberg-Stra&szlig. Now we go straight across fields and past footpaths towards the national park and its peaks.<br/><br/><br/>At the edge of the forest we go straight on along the gravel path to the national park road. We follow cycle path \"92\" to the right and shortly afterwards turn into the Martinswiese car park. Signs point us to the Racheldiensthütte. A long, beautiful stretch follows on pleasant forest roads, first across the clearing \"Martinswiese\", then through species-rich national park forest to Neuhüttenwiese. Steeper sections are asphalted. The trail leads us through a bare region. The bark beetle has left its traces here. Finally, we reach the grassy bridge with a resting place by the stream. A little further on is a display board explaining the small hills, the so-called Grüben, in the forest. Gold was mined here in the Middle Ages. Minimal gold can still be found in the pits today. Now follow a long way uphill until the path ends at a road, a creek cross and beautiful old maple trees. We take the road to the left uphill and shortly afterwards reach the Racheldiensthütte, a cosy refreshment stop. Next to the rustic Forsthütte (open in summer) is the Schachtenbachklause, which was of great importance for the timber drift in the 18th century.\n<p><br/><br/>After a rest, we cycle back down the Diensthüttenstrasse and turn left to the Rachel hedgehog bus stop and a car park. Now we cycle downhill for about 2.5 km through a thick spruce forest along the shimmering Seebach stream until we reach the Taferlruck measuring and bus station. We turn left in the direction of Guglöd, cross the Seebach, which shortly afterwards joins the Gro&szlig Ohe. On the bank with a large meadow, Bänke invite you to linger. On the forest path we reach the remote village of Guglöd at the entrance to the village at a playground and rest area. Like many other clearing islands in the forest, this place was also created on the basis of a former glassworks, which was operated in 1638 as a branch of the Riedlhütte. In 1990, an old quartz mining gallery was rediscovered, which can be reached on foot from here and where information boards illustrate quartz mining.\n</p><p><br/>We turn into the forest on the road and reach the National Park road again. Next to the road begins a cycle path that leads steeply uphill towards Siebenellen. We pass the houses of the beautifully situated settlement and an inn. We pass the moorland area of Gro&szlig Filz, one of the oldest nature reserves in Bavaria, to Sankt Oswald. A visit to the Museum of Forest History is worthwhile at the end of the tour.</p>",

With good visibility, orientation is easy, but with poor visibility and no tracks, it quickly becomes a challenge in the unclear forest terrain.</p><p>With the Schwarzentennalm, we are offered a cosy place to stop for a bite to eat directly on the trail.</p>",

            "description_long": "Our tour starts at the railway station in Lichtenfels. The district town is known as the \"German Basket Town\" - the \"Basket Market\" every year in September and many a shop in the town centre bear witness to the town's tradition as the centre of the German wicker industry and craft. At the station, we keep heading south and follow Bamberger Straße along the pavement for quite some time. This takes us through the district of Seubelsdorf before we turn left shortly before the slip road to the B173 trunk road. Passing the sports home of the SV Borussia Siedlung Lichtenfels, we come to the pilgrims' path, which leads us to the car park below the basilica. Along the access road we walk uphill to the \"Franconian Basilica\" Vierzehnheiligen. It was built where a shepherd once had an apparition and impresses with its rich, imposing baroque interior. Perhaps we will be lucky and arrive at the same time as one of the numerous pilgrimages - in this case, the ringing of bells and brass band music would accompany us. Around the basilica we come across numerous stalls and several places to stop for refreshments. After the rest, we walk uphill towards the east along the road before we follow the sign \"Staffelberg\" onto a path into the forest. We walk steadily uphill on paths and trails, partly over rocky steps, until we reach the high trail along the Alte Staffelberg up to the Staffelberg. The plateau of the Staffelberg is reached after another ascent, here we have the opportunity to stop for a break in the Staffelberg-Klause, we can also take a look at the Adelgundis Chapel, which as a pilgrimage chapel was more or less the predecessor of Vierzehnheiligen. It is a matter of honour that we walk around the plateau on the meadow path and enjoy the wonderful views in all directions.\n<br/>On the descent, we follow the signs to Bad Staffelstein at the Klause, which we reach after a good three quarters of an hour, always downhill. In the spa town, we first pass the cemetery before turning left down Lichtenfelser Straße to the market square. There you can either stop for a bite to eat or turn right and walk back to the station, which you reach after about 1 km on Bahnhofsstraße. The trains take us back to our starting point in Lichtenfels every half hour.",

In the lower part of this ski tour, flat forest paths await us; from the Priener Hütte onwards, we have to reckon with steeper slopes. These in particular can be avalanche-prone in unsafe conditions. The orientation of the slopes on which we move changes from north and west in the first part to south, west and north in the upper part. Orientation is effortless in good visibility, but can be a challenge in the upper part of the tour if visibility is poor and there are no tracks.\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

We keep half-left and follow the street \"Am Rammlinger\" to its end. There we continue on a path that goes beyond Weiherstr. and then meets Büchelesweg. Here we turn right and immediately left again onto a larger road, Albstraße, which we now follow for a long time.\n<br/>We turn left in the direction of Altsteußlingen, keep left at the turn-off to Jungviehweide in the direction of Altsteußlingen. At a sharp bend to the right, we leave the road to the left onto a forest path. We come to St. Anna-Str., which we follow briefly to the left and then turn right again into the forest at the next opportunity.\n<br/>The path we are now cycling on leads us straight through the forest for quite a while. Later, we keep to the left in the forest, i.e. in a south-easterly direction, until we meet a road. We follow it to the right for a short distance and then turn diagonally right across the road at Birkhau to Mundingen. On our way, we pass the \"Alte Säge\" (old sawmill), which offers many antique agricultural and handicraft machines and equipment as well as six vintage tractors in addition to the authentic sawmill with an intact sawing facility.\n<br/>In Mundingen, we turn right on Oberdorfer Str. through the village. We continue on this country road, which changes its name first to Granheimer Str. and then to Mundinger Str., until we reach Granheim. There you will find the Feigel Fashion Museum, which is well worth seeing and takes us back to the fashionable past. The exhibition, which changes monthly, revolves around \"fashion and earlier clothing habits\".\n<br/>We return to the point behind Mundingen where we left the forest on the way there. A few metres later, a path leads to the left, on which we cycle along the edge of the forest. At the narrowest point between the two forest areas on our left and right, we turn into the right forest area and keep south on the forest paths until we reach Mochental.\n<br/>Here the third museum on our tour awaits us. From classical modernism to the present: the baroque castle presents one of the largest and most beautiful private galleries in Germany and invites you to visit. The exhibition also includes what is probably the world's only museum of brooms.\n<br/>After Mochental we turn left and follow the road to Schlechtenfeld. Shortly before entering the village, however, we turn right, pass the wood on the right, cross the B311 and thus reach Stetten. There we keep left and pass the Käshof to Dettingen. From here, however, we do not cycle directly back to Ehingen, but make a detour to Rißtissen.\n<br/>Our next stage on the way there is Berg. To get there, we have to keep to the right in Dettingen, cycle across the fields and cross the B 465. Once we arrive in Berg, we can visit the museum in the Altes Brauhaus Berg brewery. Machines, equipment and objects of the brewing trade dating back to 1756 give a deep insight into the proud tradition of brewing history in Berg.\n<br/>Continue in a westerly direction across the fields to Griesingen. From there we take the L259, first called Talstraße and then Ehinger Straße, to Rißtissen. The Roman Museum is located in the village's school. In the contemplative museum, plans of the former Roman fort, finds from the fort and the Vicus Rißtissen, casts of Roman relief stones and finds from the Alamannic period are presented.\n<br/>We cycle back to Griesingen, but follow the L259 a little further until almost Nasgenstadt. Before entering the town and before we reach the Danube, we turn left and cycle back across the fields to Berg. From Berg we take the B465 into Ehingen. In Ehingen town centre we turn right into Schwarze Gasse and then left into Hauptstraße. Before we drive along the main street, however, it is worth taking a detour straight ahead into Spitalstraße, where there is a Franciscan monastery.\n<br/>In the imposing cloister of the former Franciscan monastery, works by the Ehingen-born artist Franz Hermann Widmer (1871-1940) are on display. You can also view selected works by Widmer in the \"Virtual Museum Ehingen\" (www.ehingen.de/virtuellesmuseum).\n<br/>Continue on the main road. After a bend to the right, Lederbruckgasse leads us to the left and then Tuchergasse to the right to the Alter Viehmarkt. On the right hand side, in Kasernengasse, we can finally take a look at the museum of the town of Ehingen. The municipal museum provides vivid background knowledge and extensive insights into the town's history. In addition to valuable sacred and profane art, you can marvel at autographs and editions of works by local dialect poets, an archaeological collection as well as farming tools and old workshop equipment of earlier craftsmen. In the recently renovated former chapel, Gothic and Mannerist wall paintings as well as outstanding examples of ecclesiastical sculpture can be seen.\n<br/>Take the Hindenburgstraße car park on the left to return to our starting point at the station.\n<br/>",

            "description_long": "We turn right from the Kurhaus into Maximilianstraße. After a right-hand bend, this becomes Bahnhofsstraße, which we follow until it meets Bergwerkstraße. We follow the signs to the left across the Ramsauer Ache to Königssee on Königsseer Straße. From here we turn left into Vorderbrandstraße in the direction of Faselsberg. Here we also find a red sign with white lettering for our route, the mountain bike route no. 9. We now ride along the road, which is very steep in places, via Mitterbach to Vorderbrand. There, the inn of the same name invites us to take a first rest. Now we continue on the road to the Hinterbrand car park (1). This is an alternative starting point for our tour: If you start from here, you save the first 500 metres in altitude. We turn left into the long car park until a red sign \"Routes 3 and 9\" sends us to the right onto a forest path. Another sign tells us that we still have 12.5 km to go to the Gotzenalm. We pass a barrier and head uphill through the forest. This and other obstacles, especially cattle grates, remind us to keep a controlled pace on the descents that follow later. Soon the hiking trail to the Gotzenalm branches off to the left, but we continue cycling straight ahead. It is strictly forbidden to cycle outside the designated routes in the Berchtesgaden National Park. Anyone who disregards this prohibition risks not only their health but also a hefty fine. Besides, the marked cycle paths are very charming, so we are not even tempted. We continue along the forest path and cross under the Jennerbahn railway. Several short descents and climbs follow. We ride through the valley of the Königsbach. Where the path runs close to the bank, we can briefly park our bike and walk along a small path to the stream. Here we find a very nice natural resting place on the bank (2). From here it is not far to the Königsbachalm (3). There we can fortify ourselves at the catered alpine hut. Shortly afterwards, our route no. 9 separates from trail no. 3. We turn right across the very beautiful Königsbachalm. At the end of the alpine meadow, our trail describes a sharp left turn. In the following section of the trail, we have several wonderful views of the Königssee lake lying deep below us. Shorter descents and ascents alternate. A longer passage leads us into the Gotzental valley. After a bridge we follow the signs to the Gotzenalm. Now we climb the remaining metres in altitude on steep serpentines to the finish. This section is the most strenuous part of the tour. When we have reached the Gotzenalm, we park our bike and walk to the right on a path to the viewpoint Feuerpalfen (4). This rewards us with fantastic views for all the exertions of the strenuous tour! We have a spectacular view of the Königssee, 1000 metres below, and St. Bartholomä as well as the mighty east face of the Watzmann. With a bit of luck we can watch golden eagles flying through their territory. The 20-metre-long electric boats of the Königsseeschifffahrt seem tiny from up here. We walk back to our bikes and continue to the right. In a few minutes we reach the turning point of the tour, which is marked by a sign with a downward pointing direction arrow. We are directly at the Gotzenalmhütte (5), which offers us a wide range of food and drinks on the very beautiful panorama terrace. After we have fortified ourselves, we return the way we came.",

The trail starts right in front of the Waldhorn Hotel (about 300 meters from the parking lot) and ends above the village in a 3.5 kilometer long and optimally developed hiking trail. After around 700 meters you land at the Jungholz treading pool with a refreshing drinking water fountain to enjoy the wonderful view of the Sorgschrofen local mountain. A few hundred meters further there is a letter (part of the letter path in Jungholz) which aims directly at the church of the village and emphasizes the idyll of the place. After further sights, such as faces carved in tree trunks, you end up at the most impressive place of this tour. The artificial snow-making lake with a wonderful and romantic view of the far-reaching Allgäu Alps is a relaxation point to dream about. The further tour ends in the village with a special church, which is very old-fashioned but very well cared for. The then signposted forest path with its pure nature reflects this excursion. Back at the Langenschwander car park, the Kamelstüble restaurant and cafe offers a calm and relaxed end to the short trip, where small but fine delicacies and drinks can also be purchased.",

Ideally, you should combine this hike with a visit to Kronburg Castle. The highest elevation of the municipality, the Hoher Rain, is on our way and on its crest there are cultural-historical sites: a Celtic high altitude sanctuary is assumed to be there and the remains of a castle complex can also be explored there. This hike then takes us downhill for a while to the hamlet of Oberbinnwang, from where we can reach the Pommersau with its mullein trees in a few minutes. On the way back to Kronburg via the hamlet of Hackenbach, we cross the so-called \"Freigraben\".

            "description_long": "The Pidinger via ferrata leads through the northern flank of Bad Reichenhall's local mountain Hochstaufen (1771 m). Established in 2003 by Sepp Reichenberger and financed by the municipality of Piding, it is one of the most difficult via ferratas in Germany. The choice of routes can be described as successful throughout. During the ascent we experience impressive views and the really strenuous ascent is rewarded by a refreshment stop almost directly at the exit. The Reichenhaller Haus (also called Staufenhaus) is located a little below the highest point of the Hochstaufen. It is open from mid-May to mid-October. The demands on our physical condition are quite high, as there is no possibility of replenishing our drinking reserves during the entire ascent. Except for a few passages, the Pidinger via ferrata is equipped with safety ropes and iron clamps throughout. It is advisable to bring a mountain bike, as most of the ascent is on a forest road. The via ferrata itself is strenuous and requires physical endurance and an absolute head for heights.<p>Videos of the Pidinger via ferrata can be viewed <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?gl=DE&hl=en&search_query=Pidinger+Klettersteig&search_type=&aq=f\">here</a>.</p>",

Avalanche danger exists in extreme weather conditions only on the slopes above the Schneibereralm. The slopes to the north and east of the summit are game protection areas and you are asked to consistently avoid these areas.",

            "description_long": "We leave the town square of Deggendorf at the southern end, cycle through the Spitaltor and past the parish church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. Soon we turn left into Hengersberger Straße and follow the Danube cycle path \"Tour de Baroque\". We cycle on the cycle lane of the through road to Deggenau. There the cycle lane changes into a separate cycle path and leads past the sports field out of the town. We cycle parallel to the motorway for a while, past fields and with a view of the Bavarian Forest. We pass the place of pilgrimage Halbmeile on the right (a detour to the rococo church is worthwhile) and follow the signs to Niederalteich. The path makes a hairpin bend and passes under the motorway. We cycle past a lake, the Luber pond. A little later we reach another lake overgrown with water lilies and reeds, an old Danube course. The road leads us along the dam and the Danube bank. In the distance we see the towers of the abbey in Niederalteich. A display board informs us about the monastery. We reach the ferry landing stage of Niederalteich with a small kiosk, the \"Radler-Tankstelle\". We turn into the village, follow the signs to the monastery and visit the Benedictine abbey, one of the oldest in Bavaria. The impression of the baroque church hall is grandiose. The side aisles are a special feature. We lock the bikes in front of the church and walk through the monastery courtyard to the monastery restaurant with its ancient vaults and beautiful beer garden. Finally, we cycle back to the ferry landing stage \"Altaha\" and cross over to Thundorf. Here, too, a visit to the rococo church is worthwhile. Until the end of the tour we follow the signs \"Isarradweg\". The ride now takes us to the mouth of the Isar, along the natural Danube. We turn right to the Grieshaus inn. The cycle path leads through the cosy beer garden. Information boards provide information about the mouth of the Isar. From here we continue to the village of Isarmünd. If you want to see where the Isar flows into the Danube, turn right in the village and follow the signs to the mouth of the Isar. At a rest area, an overgrown path leads 1.5 km through floodplain landscape. The last 400 m are on foot along a narrow path through the thicket and a view opens up of the only natural estuary of an Alpine river into the Danube. From Isarmünd, the Isar cycle path leads through sparse floodplain forest with typical trees such as alder, elm, poplar and willow. We reach the old Grafenmühle power station and the Maxmühle information centre. The museum vividly and playfully explains the floodplain landscape and its need for protection as one of the last unspoilt regions in Germany. The Grafenmühle Inn invites us to take a break. From here we follow the Isar cycle path to Plattling. We follow the main road to the right, cross the Isar bridge and reach the historic town square. At the church we turn right in the direction of Deggendorf and cycle on a cycle path that accompanies the state road. We look out for the signs \"Isarradweg\" as this soon separates from the state road. It leads along the Plattlinger Bach stream to the Pankofener Mühle mill. The old mill is still in operation today and the nice couple proudly shows you the old machines used to grind flour, including one from 1900. An old millstone is also still in working order. We cycle on to Schiltorn and then follow the road that turns left to Holzschwaig. Behind Holzschwaig we follow the road on the cycle path to Fischerdorf. We cross the Danube over the Maximiliansbrücke bridge and enjoy the view of the many bridges and the old town towers of Deggendorf before we reach the old town of Deggendorf again.",

            "description_long": "We start our bike tour from the car park in front of the church in Lengenwang. First we orientate ourselves on the road to the north and follow the bicycle signs in the direction of Seeg/Hitzleried. After 100 m we turn right into the village. We cycle through a new development area and past the sports field. The path leads us out of the village. After about 1 km of riding through pastureland, we turn right onto a small tarred road. This road is not marked with the directional signs to Seeg/Hitzleried, which have guided us up to here. However, the road is distinctive and easy to recognise, as it runs dead straight south for about 400 m, heading straight for the Alps. At its end, we continue to the right and now head for the village of Hennenschwang. There we continue to the left in front of a high hedge. We may have to push our bike on this path, which is about 100 m long and difficult to ride. Afterwards, however, we continue on an asphalt road and cycle through the beautiful Kirchthaler Moos. The path eventually leads through a farmstead. Behind it, we continue on a gravel path that first leads us up a steep ascent. We soon see the chapel of Kirchthal (1) in front of us against the magnificent Alpine backdrop. Behind Kirchthal we have a magnificent view: on the half-right we can still see the foothills of the Tannheim Mountains, while ahead the Ammergau Alps dominate the horizon. Lake Forggensee begins only 8 km from here as the crow flies, but lies hidden in the valley. Neuschwanstein Castle and Schwangau are also quite close, but the so-called Königswinkel is also hidden. Directly ahead we see Seeg. We now head downhill and touch the through road again before heading slightly uphill to Hitzleried. In the village we continue straight on, past the small chapel (2) and down into the centre of the village. Finally, we roll leisurely to the left through the Lobach valley. In the village of Lobach there is again a very small chapel in front of a farmstead, and next to it you can admire an old mill (3). We continue through the Lobach valley, where the stream feeds the wet meadows. In the region, such areas are called moss or fen. Finally, we tackle a steep ascent. On the way, we pass a cycling and hiking inn (4). At the top, we pass through Buchach and turn into Sulzschneider Forst. Here we have reached the highest point of our tour (830 m). Now we ride north on a forest path for about 2.5 km. The path has a slight gradient to offer. Soon we leave Sulzschneider Forst and head towards a farmstead, Kröbelbauer. We cycle past it to Sulzschneid. Shortly before the village centre with the church (5), we turn left towards Wald/Lengenwang/Sigratsbold. This is also the northernmost point of our cycle tour. From now on we head west/southwest again. First we ride over a small hill until we can let the bike roll down into the valley. We cross the village of Sigratsbold and then come to the main road. Follow it for 50 m to the left. Then an asphalt cycle path turns off in the direction of Lengenwang. The path takes us past Außerlengenwang and the sports field. At the crossroads behind the sports field, we continue straight ahead to Reuthe. In Reuthe we turn left, cross the railway tracks and pass the town hall of Lengenwang, where the tourist information (6) is also located. Finally, we turn left and arrive at the car park in front of the church, the starting point of our cycle tour.",

            "description_long": "Our big bike tour starts at the train station in Kaufbeuren. We turn south-west, pass the city park and cross the main road at the traffic lights. A signpost tree shows us the way there. We follow the sign in the direction of Marktoberdorf/Biessenhofen, which is also marked with a locomotive. Our tour will run along the railway tracks for a while, hence the symbol on the signs. 500 m the trail continues from here in a south-westerly direction, then it turns left and from now on we ride along the tracks. Past the Bärensee lake, we reach a roundabout before Biessenhofen, where we continue straight ahead and through the town. Before the subway at the end of Biessenhofen, we turn right towards Ebenhofen. In the small hamlet of Schleifer, we head left towards the tracks, ride through the subway and into the village of Ebenhofen. Here we go straight on through Schwabenstraße past the church, following the green bicycle sign. At the end of Ebenhofen we take the direction Immenhofen/Elbsee. The locomotive symbol on our directional signs has given way to an elk's head, as we are now heading for Elbsee. The background is the elk antlers from prehistoric times that have been found in the marshes at Elbsee. We ride through extensive meadows and pastures, through a road subway and reach Immenhofen. In the village we follow the main road on the left and then turn right into Elbseestraße. Now we go through undulating land with several forest islands, finally we pass a camping site and arrive at the Elbsee (1). From the Elbsee, we cycle along the cycle path along the small road to Aitrang, cross the crossroads and enter the village. At the village square (2) by the church, we turn left, following the road through Aitrang. We cross the tracks and cycle up to Görwangs. Here you can see a church from afar: the pilgrimage chapel of St. Alban (3), to which we should definitely make a detour. We then cycle further along the district road in the direction of Günzach. At Binnings we turn right into the village and cycle towards Friesenried. First we reach Neuenried, at just under 830 m above sea level the highest point of our tour. Our route continues to Wolfsholz and then a quick descent downhill before climbing steeply again. Even before Huttenwang we have excellent distant views in good weather (4). We pass through Huttenwang to Salenwang. In the village we turn left and cycle up an ascent, following the cycle signs to Friesenried. The hill continues all the way to Friesenried. We cross this village on the main road, turn right at the primary schools and cycle past the sports fields through the Aschthal. The flat section lasts a good 2.5 km until we have to turn left uphill before the small chapel of Aschthal, destination Oberbeuren. When you reach the main road, follow it to the right until you reach the turn-off for Großkemnat. A tower, the so-called Römerturm (Roman Tower) (5), can be seen from afar in this small village. From Großkemnat, we cycle on to the left in the direction of Kleinkemnat. There we roll down the hill to take another small climb on the Ölmühlhang, which is also the last one on our tour. Now we can let it run down to Kaufbeuren. We stay on the cycle path along the main road until we turn right into the old town (6). We cycle through the cobblestone alleys with the magnificent old buildings and rejoin the main road. We cross the traffic lights and cycle past the green area. Finally we reach the car park in front of the railway station.",

The view of the Gottesacker plateau and all the important Allgäu peaks is breathtaking. However, this tour requires alpine experience, as the north face of the Ifen only allows a small, very steep passage on foot. Orientation is easy in good visibility. If visibility is poor and there are no tracks, it can be a challenge, especially when finding the only possible gap in the Ifen south face for the descent. There is a protected forest area on the south side of the Ifen, in which only one downhill route is permitted. This route has been marked by the German Alpine Association as part of the \"Ski mountaineering environmentally friendly\" initiative. It is urgently requested that you stay away from the rest of the restricted area. The tour moves on predominantly north-facing slopes during the ascent. The short ascent of the north face is very steep. The descent is on south to south-east facing slopes of varying inclination. The passage gap of the Ifen south face is very steep. Overall, the tour can only be recommended in extremely safe conditions. After the ski tour, a detour to Café Vertical in Riezlern (opposite the Kanzelwandbahn valley station) is recommended because of the rustic-modern parlour and the delicious cakes.\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

Nevertheless, it is one of the much-travelled spring classics, especially for ski tourers. A long, partly exposed summit ridge with wire rope protections awaits us, forcing us to walk the 300 metres to the summit. The tour on mostly east-facing slopes is only recommended when the firn is safe, but never after heavy fresh snowfalls or even windy conditions during the previous days.\r\n<p>Orientation is easy when visibility is good and there are tracks. With poor visibility and no tracks, however, it quickly becomes a challenge between the Stuibensee and the summit. In total, there are about 1100 metres of ascent. With the Kreuzalm and Hochalm, there are two places to stop for refreshments on the descent.</p>",

We roll along the road towards Sonthofen and turn left behind the forest (at the bus stop) towards \"Hüttenberg\". The ascent to the Hotel Allgäuer Berghof brings sweat to our brow even in the morning hours. A tollgate forces us to dismount briefly. Past the Allgäuer Berghof, we have to master the ridge road. Shortly before the Fahnengehren-Alpe we turn right and can enjoy a trail descent (please take care of the sensitive ground). This experience is now followed by the leisurely ride into the Ostertal, where the adrenaline level drops and the senses can concentrate entirely on the beauty of the landscape. The mostly leisurely ascent to a whole series of alpine huts also contributes to this. Shortly before the Rangiswanger Alpe, many might run out of breath, because the ramp is quite steep. We combine our snack with admiring the little garden planted with plants.  Afterwards we push our bike the few metres to the saddle to do justice to nature conservation. It is only about three minutes to the summit of the Rangiswanger Horn. On the saddle, a magnificent view opens up to us of the southern Oberallgäu and the mountain scenery all around. With consideration for nature, we push on a few hundred metres further towards the valley before a path helps us to saddle up again. At the signpost towards \"Sigiswang\" we turn right.  Then we descend steeply on gravel and later on asphalt to Ofterschwang, our starting point.",

We want to reach the summit, however, and to get there we climb another 200 metres. A short, wire-rope-secured stretch leads to the summit over a rocky step, so surefootedness is required here. The majority of this technically quite easy tour leads through forest, which promises us good views of snow until well into spring.

            "description_long": "Our mountain tour starts at the gravel car park in Walchenseestraße (outskirts of Eschenlohe at the forest). First we cycle through the Eschenlaine valley, always following the course of the river of the same name. The passage is varied, leading through forests, past gorges and a lake. After about 9 km, near Einsiedel, we follow the steep path branching off to the right to the Walchensee lookout point at 1211 m. The trail then continues along a beautiful stretch. From here it is a nice downhill stretch and we can let the wind blow strongly around our ears. We cycle around the village of Wallgau on an elevated path, turning right into the forest as soon as we reach the main road and always cycling close to the edge until we reach the bridge over the Finzbach. The next highlight follows immediately with the Finzbachklamm gorge. <br/>Through the Rindbergweg and the Schweizer Alple we cycle - mostly uphill - to the Gschwandtnerbauer. Here we should definitely take a break, because more than half of the route is done and the nice atmosphere invites us to linger. An easy descent finally leads us to the village of Schlatten, from here we continue to Garmisch-Partenkirchen. We pass the St. Anton church and follow the signs on the asphalt road towards the Wankbahn valley station. We continue biking on the main road, but leave it after crossing the Loisach and ride along the river to Mühldörfl. Here we cross the river again and cycle the last few kilometres in a relaxed manner on a beautiful stretch between the forest and the Loisach to Buchwies and on to Eschenlohe back to our starting point.",

            "description_long": "The mountain bike tour starts in Immenstadt at the cemetery west of the Mittagbahn valley station, which is signposted in the town. Heading east, we reach Sonthofener Stra&szlig and follow the signs in the direction of „Blaichach\". Shortly after lmmenstadt, we turn right in the direction of „Altmummen/Ettensberg“. In Ettensberg, a sign points to „Gunzesried“, which we follow on a steep side road üvia Reute into the village. In Gunzesried, we follow the signs to \"Gunzesrieder Säge\". Continue straight ahead on the toll road until you reach the well-signposted Alpe Scheidwang, a junction in the Gunzesried hiking trail network. For the descent, we choose the path via the Helmingen alpine dairy into the Lecknertal valley, where we soon cross the border into Austria. Passing the Lecknersee lake, we reach the road via Reute near Hittisau in the direction of \"Riefensberg\". In the village of Au follow the signs to the right to the „Hochhädrich“ ski area. At the Hochhädrich hotel, the trail takes us üacross a high moorland past the Hochwies alpine pasture in the direction of „Hohenbühel“. Then continue to the right in the direction of „Obere Stieg-Alpe/Obere Lauch-Alpe\" down to the valley station of the Hochgratbahn in Steibis. From the car park at the cable car station, we cycle on a forest road that is closed to general traffic through the Ehrenschwanger Tal valley, past the Mittlere Simatsgund-Alpe, up to the Untere Eck-Alpe. The forest road continues to lmmenstadt. From the Untere Eck-Alpe we turn left on a lonely gravel path, later on on a trail to the Alpe Seifenmoos, the mountain rescue station. From there we take the wide forest path through the Steigbach valley back to the cemetery inmmenstadt, our starting point. We stay on the road for the last part of the way, the right fork is a footpath that is closed to cyclists.\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

            "description_long": "We start our panoramic walk at the car park above the monastery in Dietramszell. We walk downhill and past the Dietramszell monastery (1). Behind the monastery we keep to the right and follow the signposted road to Obermühlthal. For 2 km we walk along the Zellerbach - a wonderful idyllic landscape awaits us. After passing through Obermühltal, we turn right towards Niederreuth. Behind the small footbridge over the Zellerbach we enter the forest and later into open terrain. Finally we see Walleiten. However, we do not enter the village, but continue straight on to Hechenberg. Here we have the opportunity to take a shortcut: if you don't want to make the detour to Hechenberg, you can hike directly to Helfertsried from here and then rejoin the Hechenberger Aussichtsrunde. Our actual route to Hechenberg runs in a constant up and down. In Hechenberg (2) the restaurants around the village square offer us the opportunity to take a break. After strengthening ourselves, we make a U-turn, keep to the right and hike along a small side road to Helfertsried. Here we go uphill to the right. We stay on the road until we reach the state road 2368 after a descent. We cross it and walk straight ahead into the forest. Now we follow the large signs. We stay on the forest path until we reach a wooden sign pointing us left to Kirchsee and right to Bad Tölz. We keep to the right and at the next opportunity turn left, again towards Bad Tölz. Soon we leave the forest and in front of us is the Kogl farm, which we cross. Behind the farm we go downhill until we turn left onto the hiking trail S5 to Kirchsee. Now the path runs directly along the shore of the Kirchsee (3). Enjoy the wonderful view, including the church of Sachsenkam. There are numerous park benches on the shore and nothing stands in the way of a short rest. Finally, the path along the riverbank changes to Kirchseestrae. To the left and right of the path, many a beautiful house is hidden in the forest. At the eastern end of the Kirchsees there is a kiosk (4), a car park and public toilets. From the kiosk we also reach the bathing beach. We now walk on to Stubenbach, where we keep to the left. Behind the village, a forest track begins. A wooden sign signals that we are back on the hiking trail towards Dietramszell. We stay on the path until we come to Wampen Moos. Soon we find another signpost to Dietramszell. We go right, at the next opportunity left uphill and at the next crossroads straight on. We leave the black cross and the green cross on the right and go downhill on the left. Again we follow the signs (wooden arrow on the tree) in the direction of Dietramszell. At the unsigned T-junction we turn left. We hike downhill to the right again and then see the small chapel \"Maria Elend\" (5) between the Bäumen. The interior of the small chapel, which is open to visitors, is also worth seeing. Behind the chapel, somewhat hidden, are park benches where we can rest. We now walk past the parish hall and back to the monastery. If you feel like it, you can visit the monastery shop. Finally, we can fortify ourselves in the monastery tavern to end the day.",

            "description_long": "The Legauer Radrunde is characterised by side roads with hardly any traffic and wonderful views of the gentle mountain ranges of the Unterallgäu. We start directly at the town hall in Legau in the centre of the village, where we also find sufficient parking facilities. We pass the town hall and turn right at the crossroads. After a short while we turn left again into Wiesweg and follow the local road, later a side road, to the village of Wies. Here we turn left and continue along the road until we reach another side road. Here we keep to the right and immediately turn right again, following the signs to \"Maria Steinbach\". Now we first cross a bridge, then the district road straight ahead. After the climb, we enjoy the view of Maria Steinbach for the first time. Several stone Stations of the Cross also await us - signs of Allgäu folk piety. A brisk descent brings us to the village of Maria Steinbach - and after a short climb we are already standing in front of the imposing pilgrimage church of Maria Steinbach (1). The church is not only impressive from the outside, but also from the inside. So a visit is a must! The history of Maria Steinbach as a place of pilgrimage began in June 1730. The faithful here claim to have noticed strange things about a statue of Our Lady: Maria discoloured her face, she cried tears and moved her eyes and eyelids. Word of the apparitions spread. Soon reports of answered prayers were making the rounds. At Whitsun 1734, the recognition of the pilgrimage was celebrated with a magnificent thanksgiving festival attended by between 20 and 30,000 visitors. From then on, the news of help from the image of grace increased. Alongside Altötting, Ettal, Maria Einsiedeln and the Wieskirche, Maria Steinbach became one of the most important pilgrimage sites in the German-speaking south. Soon the church was too small. A larger church was built and consecrated in 1755. Only 20 years after the completion of the new church, the heyday came to an end. After a visit to the church and a rest, we continue up the road and turn left into the hollow way before the end of the village. At the end of the path, we keep to the right and come across more Stations of the Cross along the side road. The view back gives us impressive impressions of the Unterallgäu mountain ranges and the pilgrimage church of Maria Steinbach in the foreground. We reach Kaltbronn (2) on the road and continue to Hub, where we cross the intersecting road and reach another road on a field path through the forest. We cross this road slightly to the left before a farm track takes us to Bettrichs. Here we first turn right and then left, before we turn left and then right in Felben. We stay on the road and get through Oberlandholz (3) and Außerlandholz and over the incline to Voglers, Bruggen and Raggen. Here we turn right onto the road to Ausnang. First you reach St. Leonhard (4), where you can take a rest at the chapel of the same name. In the next village, Ausnang (5), there is also ample opportunity for refreshment - here the local inns offer a good selection. We cycle through the village in a northerly direction and orient ourselves at the crossroads by the signposts to Hofs and Rangis. Now we use the cycle path for a while, which takes us to Hofs (6). In this typical Unterallgäu village, we orient ourselves to the north in the direction of Rangis. The road runs partly next to the Ach. At the next junction, we turn right, cross the Ach and take the climb up to the Legau heights, where we are once again offered a magnificent view of the Unterallgäu and the market town of Legau. Now gravity takes us comfortably and effortlessly down to Legau, where we first turn left and then right twice. Finally, we arrive back at the town hall in Legau.",

The tour is only recommended in spring, as it is very dangerous for avalanches after fresh snowfall. In the Saugasse we find very steep slopes, as well as on the ascent to the Funtenseetauern. Due to the low frequency of use and thus the lack of tracks, orientation is often quite challenging. The Sagereckwand forces us to descend steeply on foot, as it is usually already free of snow in spring! Accordingly, surefootedness and alpine experience are necessary - especially as we usually have to descend with ski boots!</p>\n<p> </p>",

The trail leads past the stream first to the Schwaben-Alpe, then on towards the \"Freyburger Alpe\" and the Dinigörgen-Alpe. Behind this alp, we keep left at the fork in the road in the direction of „Toniskopf-Alpe“. Soon the asphalt path ends. We continue for about 800 m to the beginning of the forest. Then begins a pushing stretch down to Gasthof Rohrmoos, one of the many places to stop along the way. <br/>The route takes us back to the asphalt triangle and then to the left onto an unpaved path that joins the toll road again on the north side of the Rohrmooser Starzlach, shortly before Hüttenbühl. We cycle through Ferlewang and past the \"Jägerwinkel\" inn on to Winkel and down to Tiefenbach. In the village we turn left onto the main road until we reach the fork in the road and then do not stay on the main road, but turn right in the direction of Greith.

            "description_long": "From car park P7, we follow the unpaved path directly along the shore of Lake Forggensee in a southerly direction. At the jetty we have to push the bike, then we follow the signs to Füssen. After 1.5 km we see the mighty Lech weir on the left, 50 m behind it we cross under the B17 federal road to Schwangau. Now we continue along the western bank of the Lech to the Theresienbrücke bridge below the historic town centre of Füssen. On this bridge we cross the Lech. After the bridge, turn right onto the cycle path, which climbs slightly in the direction of Reutte/Tyrol - as far as the Lech Falls (1). It is worth stopping here. The waters of the Lech plunge impressively through the narrow gorge. This spectacle is particularly impressive at high water. Since the 18th century, man has harnessed the power of the water by blasting drainage tunnels into the rock to power mills. Today, electricity is generated with the help of these artificial tunnels. We continue in the direction of Reutte and pass the border to Austria at the end of the village of Ziegelwies. Weißhaus is already on the territory of the neighbouring country. After about 400 m we reach the \"Weißhaus\" power station, 50 m behind it we look out for an unpaved path that branches off to the left of the road. We follow the signs \"Pinnswang über Kratzer\". Now we struggle uphill through the forest over a steep gravel ramp. Once we have reached the hill, a narrow path leads us downhill towards the south. We pass a pasture fence. The yellow signs to \"Reutte\" lead us to Schluxen (2), a farmed estate that invites you to take a break. We pass the inn and come across an information board on the Via Claudia Augusta at a crossroads. Our section of the trail is part of an ancient transit \"road\" across the Alps. At this board we turn left, signposted \"Dreiländereck 1,5 h\". We continue on the road towards the mountain massif of the Schwarzenberg. After about 500 m in a slight ascent, our path leads up the mountain to the left. We return to this point after the ascent. Now we face the most strenuous part of our tour: the ascent to the Dreiländereck. Turn after turn, the gravel path leads us up the sunny southern slope. We have fantastic views of the valley of the Lech and look down on the opposite peaks of Vilser Kegel, Karrel and Plattjoch. We always orientate ourselves by the signpost \"Dreiländereck\". When we reach the signpost pointing up to the Dreiländereck on the right, a pushing section follows. We therefore leave our bikes here and climb the last stretch to the summit on foot. At the top of the peak, a signpost invites you to take a detour to the old border stone (3). It marks the geographical point where the borders of the Augsburg Collegiate Church, the Kingdom of Bavaria and the County of Tyrol met in 1844. We walk and ride back down into the valley, turning left at the signpost \"Königsschlösser 12 km\". At first we enjoy a descent. Finally, there are several climbs ahead before we reach the border to Germany, the Alpsee and Hohenschwangau. In Hohenschwangau (4) we have a wide choice of places to stop. We ride on the asphalted road past the tourist shops, down to the tourist information. Here we keep to the left and join the cycle path towards Füssen. We cycle parallel to the main road as far as the cycle and pedestrian bridge (5) over the Lech, then left down to the path along the river bank, which we already used on the outward journey. Our path continues past the weir to the boat harbour and to our starting point.",

The descent should also be done with great caution in case of wetness or residual snow. If you are late or tired after a successful ascent, the Matrashaus on the Hochkönig is a good place to spend the night.

The toboggan run is a good 4 km long, relatively narrow and steep in the upper part, where you have to be considerate of others.

            "description_long": "The starting point of our hike is the Deutschordensschloss (Castle of the Teutonic Order) in the centre of Bad Mergentheim, which housed the High and German Masters of the Teutonic Order for over 300 years. Our path leads through the castle grounds and the castle park, which is laid out as an English landscape garden, towards the Tauber. We cross the river and then turn right into Lothar-Daiker-Straße. Parallel to the Tauber, we now pass the open-air swimming pool and the sports facilities to Igersheim. We cross the town by keeping to the right at the entrance to the town, first along Erlenbachtalstraße and then Bahnhofstraße and, after crossing the B19 federal road, turn right into Bad Mergentheimer Straße, which takes us across the Tauber again. Directly behind the river, a forest path branches off to the left and takes us to Neuhaus Castle. Neuhaus Castle used to be owned by the noblemen of Hohenlohe-Brauneck until it was taken over by the Teutonic Order and used as an armoury and armoury. At the castle, we turn left and walk across fields and along rows of trees and hedges towards the B290. We always have the Wartturm on the Kaiserstraße, the former army and trade route, in view. It used to serve the Teutonic Order as a lookout tower. Our path meets the main road, but we keep to the right and hike back to Bad Mergentheim on the Alemannenweg. If you like, you can make a detour to the Wartturm (watchtower) from where you have a great view. Passing the old cemetery, we return to the centre of Bad Mergentheim and the Deutschordensschloss. Finally, a visit to the Deutschordensmuseum is a good idea. In addition to the largest coherent exhibition on the Teutonic Order, exhibits on the town's history, the Eduard Moerike cabinet and an extensive doll's house collection are on display here.",

We follow the white-green cycle path sign \"Donauradweg\". At Haissengasse we cross under the road and arrive directly at Passau's Danube harbour. We finally turn left in the direction of the \"Innradweg\", keep to the right at Obere Donaulände and then immediately left again into Große Klingergasse. From here we have to push our bike a little way through Passau's pedestrian zone, where there are numerous small shops and cafés to discover. We continue straight ahead along Theresienstraße until we reach Gottfried-Schäffer-Straße. We cross this and reach the Inn below the cathedral. Here we turn right and cycle along the Inn promenade. We cycle upstream past the university to the access road to the Inn barrage Passau-Ingling. There we meet the Innstraße, where we continue to follow the signposting of the Innradweg. Here we also see the white-green signposting of the Apfel-Radl Weg for the first time. Past the barrage, we continue cycling through the forest - along the Inn. Finally we reach the arboretum - a plantation of trees and shrubs from all over the world. We cross the Soldatenbrunn and Schwarzsägbach streams and arrive at Neuburg am Inn along the draw path. On the opposite side we see Wernstein. Since September 2006, a new cycle and footpath bridge connects the two towns. From Neuburg we cycle past the climbing garden to Vornbach. At the Schauerödstraße there, we turn left and thus come across the Abt-Rumpler-Straße. Here we have the opportunity to make a short detour to the left to the Vornbach monastery church. Finally, we keep to the right and continue straight ahead on the Graf-Eckbert-Weg until we reach Niederschärding. Here we continue to follow the white-green \"Innradweg\" signs to Neuhaus am Inn. From there we have a unique view of picturesque Schärding on the opposite side. At the level of Neuhaus Castle, we come across a road and keep left. Soon we leave the Inn cycle path and turn right. We cross the road and cycle straight ahead on the Höchfeldener Weg on the other side. This takes us under the main road to Sulzbach am Inn. At Neuhauser Straße we turn left and then right again into Berginger Straße. We leave Sulzbach on this road and cycle along the railway tracks, under the motorway to Engertsham. There we turn left into Schmiedbergstraße. Continue straight ahead until you reach Bad Höhenstadt. Here we turn right in the direction of Fürstenzell. Via Kemating we finally reach Aspertsham. There is the railway station Fürstenzell, from where we can take the train back to Passau. However, we do not miss the short detour to Fürstenzell and the monastery there. To do this, we turn left and cycle along the cycle path to Markt Fürstenzell and arrive at the Fürstenzell monastery. Of course, nothing stands in the way of continuing along the entire Apfel-Radl path. We would then return to our starting point via Ortenburg, Sammarei, Grongörgen, Aldersbach and Vilshofen.",

In order to meet this great challenge as quickly as possible, the Bavarian State Forestry Administration decided to build a narrow-gauge forest railway. This is how the Neuhauser Bockerlbahn came into being in 1920. Unfortunately, only a few remains of the walls and a few pillars are left of the 12 km long railway line. To ensure that this technical masterpiece is not forgotten, the Bockerlbahnweg was created along the former route. Along the way, 20 information boards tell the history and report on the difficult terrain conditions that could only be overcome with ingenuity and sophisticated technology;",

            "description_long": "We cycle from the village square in Stetten and leave the village in a southerly direction. At Mühlenhaug we turn left, encounter a sign for a cycle path and follow it. We cycle along several fish ponds and finally cycle across meadows and fields towards Nordheim. On this stretch we always follow the signposted cycle path, which lets us branch off to the right once and then, close to the little river Bahra, points to the left again into the village of Nordheim. There we cross the Sondheimer Straße and continue on the cycle path, which first leads us along the railway tracks for a while, then veers off to the left and leads us past a pond. The route is slightly downhill until Ostheim and we enjoy the landscape on paved cycle paths. Shortly before Ostheim, we have to turn right and cycle a short distance in the opposite direction. We cross two river courses of the Streu and keep left again before the tracks. Now we cycle for a short time along a water nature trail and reach a Kneipp facility (1) with a resting bench and children's playground in the village of Ostheim. Here you can take your first break. Afterwards, the characteristics of our tour gradually change. We cycle south, cross the road to Ostheim and cycle up Ludwig-Jahn-Straße to the sports ground. At the tennis courts we reach a fork, where we choose the middle path and can already see the Heidelberg in front of us. We go around the Kleiner Lindenberg, which rises on our left and soon reach a fish pond where the forest begins. At the foot of the Großer Lindenberg, the road now climbs steadily. We first take a long left-hand bend, then a sharp hairpin bend and reach a crossroads. In the middle there is a tree trunk on which a carved owl (2) is sitting. Here we turn right and descend again over the foothills of the Heidelberg, which stretch along to our right. At the end of the forest we have to slow down and cross two roads in quick succession on dirt tracks. This is how we finally reach the town of Frickenhausen. We cycle past the war memorial, then the church and come to the Grüner Baum inn (3). It is closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, otherwise it offers snacks and refreshments from 4 pm. We continue down to the crossroads. There we discover a tour marker for mountain bikers, which leads us across the road and past a farm. Now we begin another long ascent over the ridge of the Heidelberg. The tour still leads moderately uphill along field paths. We pass a small wood on the right, then turn left again and reach an asphalt road. We cycle on it again until we reach a junction where the tarred track ends and we keep to the right. A road follows, which we have to cross. Then we cycle steeply uphill to the edge of the forest. In the shade of the trees, we now ride left along the forest, partly over roots and stony ground. Good technique is required here. At the foot of the Windberg, the long climb is over for now. We cycle downhill through the forest, reach an open area again, where we now have to cycle uphill to the edge of the forest on the right and along the trees on the left. The view is wonderful up here and we can see, among other things, the ridge of the Kreuzberg with its prominent radio tower in the west. At the point where we ride deeper into the forest again, there is a bench (4) and offers us a resting place to catch our breath. Further on, we descend immediately to the right and come across a forest road, where we turn left, thus coming out of the forest again and reaching a road. Keep left here and cycle to the crossroads. There we turn right and finally return to Stetten on the road via Sondheim, where we can stop off at the Gasthaus \"Zur Linde\".",

From there we turn right into Steinstraße and then turn left along Giengener Straße. In front of the Netto supermarket, Erzknappenweg turns off to the right. Follow this until you reach steps after 300 m, which take you to Sonnenrainweg. There we turn left and follow the path marked with a rhombus for 2 km.

The Ötterlesbrunnen is a spring outlet above the karst water table, whose name refers to an \"Etter\", a marker boundary.\n<br/>After this detour, we go back again, following the Albvereinsweg path straight ahead for 200 m through the forest. Via a gravel path on the right, we come along the quarry fence to the viewing platform above the quarry. From there we can see a bizarre group of rocks. Here, marl rock consisting of clay and lime was extracted from pits or mine shafts. After 300 m, the observatory is on the right. It was inaugurated in September 2006 and is the first and so far the only one in the district. Information is available at: www.astronomie-heidenheim.de. Continue downhill and turn left before the houses to the Kinderfestplatz. At the TV transfer station, a footpath leads about 300 m to a viewing rock at the Hohlenstein. We walk back to the observatory and continue along the path until we reach the road \"Oberer Erbisberg\", where we turn left, walk to the Naturfreundehaus and cross the playground. Approx. 400 m up the hill, a footpath leads to the viewing rock on the Rappeshalde. Presumably wine was once grown here, \"Rappes\" indicates artificial wine made from marc. Back at the Naturfreundehaus, we hike along the Erzknappenweg to the Netto shopping centre and turn left there into the path \"Am Baderhölzle\".

            "description_long": "The tour starts at Treuchtlingen railway station, from where the Bahnhofstrasse leads us in a southerly direction to the Hauptstrasse, which we follow a little to the left. We walk around the town hall square (1), which with its time-honoured buildings in the heart of the old town provides a wonderful flair, which is rounded off by small shops and cafés. We continue past the church until we reach the canal road, which takes us out of the city. When we reach the Altmühl, the idyllic green spaces that accompany us on the way along the river bank begin. Soon we reach Dietfurt at the foot of the Weitstein, which forces the Altmühl to take a sharp bend at this point. Over a bridge we change banks and reach a scenically outstanding passage - the so-called „Weißjuraabschnitt“ owes its name to the characteristic white rock that runs through the Böden. We follow the meandering river through wooded hills and reach Pappenheim. A bridge leads into the town, which is dominated by historical buildings and where the ruins of Pappenheim Castle (2) stand out. The estate is enthroned on a hill that rises directly in the built-up area. We cycle along the southern flank through the long town area, which we leave only after a second river loop. On the right bank of the Altmühl we now cycle through the narrow river valley to Solnhofen. The town has become world-famous for its archaeological finds. Fossils up to 150 million years old can be found in the Plattenkalk, and hobby collectors can look for them themselves in the visitor's quarries. Behind the village, the river describes a right-hand bend where the „Twelve Apostles“ (3), the landmark of the Altmühltals, can be found - the jagged limestone rocks have been formed by erosion over thousands of years. At the mouth of the Gailach we come to Altendorf, where the pilgrimage church of Maria End (4) is slightly offset to the right. We ride over a bridge and make a short series of smaller ascents that take us past the Kruspelberg to the Einödsleite. In the shade of the Bäume we go to Hagenacker and then through the marshy Pfahläcker to Dollnstein. Behind the tranquil market, the Burgstein rock (5), which rises 45 metres into the air, comes into view. Our route describes a left turn that leads us past Breitenfurt and in a wide loop to Wasserzell. The side arms of the Altmühl run through the wet meadows of the widening valley and we come closer to our destination Eichstätt, which is already announced from afar by the Willibaldsburg (6). We continue to Eichstadt station, where we end our tour. The beautiful old town of the university town nestles along a picturesque river bend and can be reached easily via Spitalbrücke.",

However, the real challenge begins here: More than 700 meters in altitude await in just 6.2 kilometers - an average gradient of 11.5 percent, which even rises to an impressive 20 percent in some sections. Every pedal stroke counts as the racing bike fights its way up the mountain.</p>\n<p>The road carved into the rock winds spectacularly along the rocky flanks of the Kehlstein. There is a special silence up here in November - no tourist buses, no traffic, just your own panting and the quiet whirring of tires on the asphalt. The decision to ride this tour in November proves to be absolutely right: from March to October, this road bike route would be off-limits anyway due to the bus traffic.</p>\n<p>The views become more spectacular with every meter of elevation gain. The technically demanding route demands maximum concentration, while the view over the Berchtesgadener Land opens up more and more. After 10.6 kilometers and a total of 1197 meters in altitude, I finally reach the parking lot of the Kehlsteinhaus at 1709 meters. The historic building, also known as the Eagle's Nest, towers majestically over the valley.</p>\n<p>Sweat freezes in the cool November air as I pause for a moment to enjoy the view. Looking back at the hairpin bends I have mastered gives me an idea of what a masterpiece of engineering this road is - even if its history during the Nazi era casts a dark shadow.</p>\n<p>The descent requires full attention once again: the steep passages and tight bends demand respectful handling of the brakes. But the feeling of having mastered one of the most impressive road bike tours in Germany makes up for all the effort.</p>",

The two long climbs to the Nassereither Alm and the Marienbergjoch are strenuous and energy-sapping. The descent from the Nassereither Alm begins with panoramic views and beautiful, narrow serpentines. Soon, however, it continues on a technically difficult single trail that leads over scree and mountain pine fields along the slope down to Nassereith. Only excellent trail specialists will have fun here. For most others,  pushing is the order of the day, at least in sections. At the end of the tour, everyone will once again enjoy a fast downhill ride. With a lot of pleasure, we can cruise directly over the grassy ski slope down into the valley.",

From the car you can see that you're entering a picturesque part of the Oberallgäu, because you can't miss these imposing vertical rock faces, and I dare say it would be a shame to miss them. Even though the mountain is covered in clouds again and again, it is still beautiful and even a little mystical in this weather. So we jumped out of the car and headed for the limestone cliff of Besler, 1679 metres high. From here we hoped to head east all the way to the Breitach valley, which eventually failed due to clouds. The view below us is only glimpsed for a few moments. If the views had been better and we hadn't been soaked to the skin, we would certainly have climbed the Beslerkopf, which is lower than Besler, and the Beslergrat, which can also be climbed with a detour. Our route took us over concrete, dirt tracks and oddly shaped limestone, surrounded by gravity-defying cows and donkeys at will. The climb was manageable, but in wet weather it would have been more stable with poles, as you can slide here and there on the limestone. Refreshments were available at the seasonally open alp at the beginning and end of the hike. Overall, we would recommend it to everyone, as it is beautiful in rain and sunshine.",

After the moderate climb to the Raut-Alm, the idyll is over for the time being. A steep trail leads down to the Schwarzenbach before we have to make our way up to the Langenecksattel. On the very steep ascent, a short carrying passage awaits us right at the beginning. But then we are rewarded with a fantastic trail down into the Reichenau valley. We continue on lonely forest paths to Walchensee, one of the most beautiful and deepest mountain lakes in Germany. Here you can cool off in the cool water. Due to the length of the tour, a good level of fitness is required.",

A relaxed ride takes you along the riverbank through beautiful wet meadows and past tranquil villages and old aristocratic estates.",
            "description_long": "Our cycle tour starts at Nuremberg's main railway station, from where we have the opportunity to make a detour to the Germanic National Museum (1), which is located not far from the starting point in Kartäusergasse. Here you get a multi-layered insight into German art and culture, including pictures by Albrecht Dürer, Biedermeier furniture and the so-called \"Erdapfel\" - a globe made as early as 1492, making it one of the oldest realistic representations of the earth. We cycle along Gleißbühlstraße to the Pegnitz, which will accompany us for long stretches. From the island of Schütt, we take the Johann-Soergel-Weg, which runs through the Pegnitz meadows, changes banks and heads east along the river. The lake soon widens into the long Wöhrder See (2), on whose northern shore we are accompanied by trees and green spaces (alternatively, we can also follow the southern shore path, but then we have to change to the northern shore at the Eibenseesteg at the latest). The lake soon narrows again to the river, which we follow for a while along the railway line and then ride out of town through the wet meadows. At the end of a long river loop, the slightly hidden ruin of Oberbürg (3) awaits us on the right side of the path. Then, away from the river, we pass under the motorway to Schwaig. A bridge leads to Behringersdorf, from where it continues along the Sebald Reichswald. A little above the Pegnitz, we pass Rückersdorf and shortly afterwards arrive in Lauf. Here we pass Wenzel Castle (4), which lies on a small island in the middle of the river. The Pegnitz leads us along curves to a motorway bridge, behind which our cycle path follows the B14. The built-up area now visibly gives way to beautiful wet meadows. We keep to the right towards Ottensoos, which lies on the other side of the Pegnitz. We quickly leave the church (5) behind us and continue cycling slightly uphill under the leafy canopy of the Sandholz. We meet the railway line, which we follow to Henfenfeld, which is surrounded by fields on a wide plain. The structural picture is dominated by Henfenfeld Castle (6), which is visible from afar with its red and white striped shutters. Our route now runs to the left and turns towards the bank of the strongly meandering Pegnitz, which we leave again at the height of Hersbruck. We ride through farmland to the small town of Happurg, at the southern edge of which the beautiful Happurger See (7) awaits us. We circle the body of water counterclockwise and then return to Hersbruck along the familiar route. There we follow the Ostbahnstraße over a bridge into the northern part of the town. After a short ride, we arrive at the railway station of the small town, where we have reached the destination of our tour.",

We do this on the Bad Wiesseer Höhenweg, which leads to the Aueralm, and on the Panoramahöhenweg to the Neuhütteneck, where we enjoy breathtaking views at many points. Particularly noteworthy are the views of the Isar valley and the Karwendel from the Lenggrieser Hütte. But this excursion is also worthwhile thanks to the great cultural landscape around the Auerhalm and the Rauhalm. We cover most of our route on good forest and cart tracks, passing some steep sections both uphill and downhill. All in all, however, this tour can be characterised as easy to moderately difficult and is therefore also well suited for \"occasional bikers\".",

It is the highest peak of the Wendelstein massif. Because of its exposed position, it offers a very good view of the Bavarian Alpine foothills and, conversely, can be seen in a wide radius. On the summit of the mountain there is a rich infrastructure with the Wendelstein Chapel, an observatory, a weather station, a geopark and a broadcasting station of the Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation that can be seen from afar. The Wendelstein rack railway should also be mentioned, as it is the oldest mountain railway in Germany. In the course of the tour, we can enjoy constantly changing views of the Wendelstein, the Inn Valley and the Chiemgau Alps and conclude the panoramic ride with the already mentioned great view from the Wendelstein . The profile of the route divides nicely between gravel paths and trails, except for a short section on asphalt. However, the tour is not necessarily recommended for inexperienced riders due to steep climbs and riding challenges.",

Main - Gemünden (22 km)</p>\n<p>After we were able to rest a little yesterday - as far as the altitude metres are concerned - today we are faced with two challenging climbs. From the Sohlhöhe, however, we experience a magnificent view of the northern Spessart. Apart from the mills on the Sindersbach, we will hardly see any traces of human settlement during the rest of the hike and should therefore provide for water and provisions. The Maintalhöhenringweg ends in Gemünden, the gateway to the Spessart and Rhön.</p>",

            "description_long": "At over 750 metres, Siegmundsburg lies at the very top of the Thuringian Slate Mountains, where the long-distance hiking trail \"Rennsteig\" also runs through. The source of the Werra (1) and the Dreistromstein are also nearby. From this watershed, the water separates and flows into the three rivers Elbe, Weser and Rhine, which is unique in Europe. We start in Siegmundsburg and immediately follow the cycle path along the B28. Our path leads us partly steeply downhill through the forest before we reach Sachsenbrunn. Now we pass through the village and find ourselves in an idyllic landscape of woods and meadows. We reach Eisfeld. A seemingly untouched nature has developed in the region. Since the fall of communism, the traditional Eisfeld has flourished. Many festivals are celebrated here, and the old school, castle (2), Otto Ludwig memorial and a leisure park are worth seeing. Finally, we drive out through the town on Schwarburger Strasse, then Neulehen Strasse. On the way, we cross the railway tracks on the Dammweg. Via Brockstadt with its castle we cycle a curve to Harras. Close to the B 89, our route leads to Veilsdorf, where rustic inns invite you to stop for a bite to eat. The village road takes us back into the countryside. Finally, we take a short detour through Birkenfeld before entering Hildburghausen on the Dammstraße. At the large market square with baroque houses we find the Rennaissance town hall. From the Bismarck Tower (3) we have a good view of the castle park and the Catholic and Christ Church. We can now take a rental boat across the castle pond or find out more about the region in the Alte Post town museum.",

            "description_long": "Our cycle tour begins at Neuenmarkt station, which we leave on Bahnhofstraße and immediately cross the tracks on a bridge. On the left we see the church (1) of Neuenmarkt, while we turn right on Laubenstraße and follow the branching Schmellenweg. It goes slightly uphill at first, while we cross the tracks twice in short succession. Soon we exchange fields for dense foliage and take a right turn through the Laubenholz. Parallel to the B303, we follow a scenic route to Himmelskron. Here we pass the former monastery of Himmelskron, once inhabited by an order of Cistercian nuns and later by the Bayreuth market count, with the well-known collegiate church of St. Maria (2). The originally Gothic church was later baroqueised and is listed as one of the most important sacred buildings in Upper Franconia in the Bavarian list of monuments. The Weiße Main flows to the right as we leave the monastery village to the south. Shortly before the tranquil castle village of Lanzendorf, we reach the riverbank, along which we cycle to the Old Main Bridge (3) and then turn left. At the edge of the village, a bridge takes us over the A9. Now we leave the built-up area, come closer to the meandering Weißmain again through fields and green areas and finally change the bank side. Soon we reach the spa town of Bad Berneck, where the Ölschnitz and Weißmain rivers meet. We follow the Maintalstraße (B303) from the mouth of the Ölnitz (4) out of the town, but then stay on the cycle path on the left bank. Under the pleasant shade of the Buchholz trees, we pass the hamlets of Goldmühl, Escherlich and Schmelz. On a more steeply ascending route, we cycle through the narrowing Weißmaintal, which by now nestles between the western foothills of the Fichtelgebirge and curves in an easterly direction. Despite the incline, we can enjoy the wonderful nature along the picturesque course of the river. At Glasermühle we cross the White Main for the last time and cycle into the spa town of Bischofsgrün, which is announced to us by the Protestant church (5). We cycle on the main road through the town until we turn off on Wunsiedler Straße in the direction of Fröbershammer. There we keep to the right and set off on the final spurt to the valley station of the Ochsenkopf (6). The source mountain of the White Main is considered a landmark of the Fichtelgebirge, with the stone Asenturm tower enthroned on its summit, offering an outstanding view over the surrounding countryside and its forested mountain ranges. We then return along the same path, which is almost entirely downhill, to Neuenmarkt.",

The ride over the narrow path, which is quite winding in the meantime, gives us the greatest pleasure. The last descent from the Dalsensattel down into the Priental is no less exciting. A cart track that is as rough as it is steep leads us through the wildly romantic Klausgraben down into the valley. The utmost attention is required here.",

            "description_long": "We follow Bahnhofstraße to the traffic lights and go straight on into Wasserkuppenstraße. Soon we can turn onto the cycle path that runs alongside the road on the right. At the end of the village, this leads us across Moorstraße onto a field path. Here we follow the mountain bike signs in the direction of \"Wasserkuppe 7 km\". The route climbs gently but steadily. We cycle through the idyllic Fulda valley. After cycling on the road for a short while, the signs lead us to the left onto a field path. Shortly before we cross the Fulda on a concrete bridge, a beautifully situated bench (1) invites us to take a breather. At a fork, we choose the right alternative onto a small asphalt road. This leads us to Obernhausen. Here we follow the cycle path signs. We ride briefly on the country road until we turn left onto an asphalt path. Below the path we see a ski lift. A bench (2) to the right of the track offers us a wonderful view back into the Fulda valley. The asphalt path eventually turns into a gravelled dirt road. We follow the signs to the Wasserkuppe and soon recognise its summit with its distinctive knoll. Weather permitting, we can observe numerous gliders taking off from the Wasserkuppe. Our path finally meets the Hochrhönring. To the left of the track is the beautifully landscaped Fuldaquelle spring with a rest area. We follow the road up to the Wasserkuppe. Here we can visit the Rhön Info Centre (3) and the German Gliding Museum. Numerous restaurants invite you to stop for a bite to eat. We first return the way we came and follow the Hochrhönring on a rapid descent until it meets the Bundesstra0e. Cross the road and continue straight ahead. The path soon bends to the right and leads us through the Rote Moor, a magnificent nature reserve, the largest moor in the Rhön. We follow the path across an open passage with a magnificent view into the forest. There we turn left to the lookout tower (4). This offers us very beautiful far-reaching views of the moorland. We push our bike along the wooden plank path leading through the moor. Finally, we cross a small forest of Carpathian birch trees, the occurrence of which is unique in Europe. Numerous information boards inform us about these and other special features of the Red Moor. At the end of the boardwalk, we turn right to a crossroads. There we follow the mountain bike signs to the left onto the Westweg in the direction of Bischofsheim and Schwedenwall. We pass a beautiful resting place on the left of the path (5). At a T-junction, we turn right towards Schwedenwall and Gersfeld. We cycle on an asphalt road to the Schwedenwall parking lot and turn right towards Gersfeld. We now cycle on a beautiful route downhill to Gersfeld and enjoy a wonderful distant view that encompasses large parts of our tour such as the Fulda valley and the Wasserkuppe. On the outskirts of the beautifully situated village of Morbach, we can stop off at the Jagdstube (6). At the fork near the Jadgstube, we choose the left alternative. We reach Gersfeld. At the traffic lights we turn left and return to the starting point. There we find a special attraction for all cyclists: \"Pedale\", the oldest bicycle pub in Germany, offers gastronomic delights and an attached repair and spare parts workshop. Bicycle parts are integrated in a variety of ways in the interior design, right up to the tap system.",

Here the Hochrhöner divides into an eastern and a western route. On the latter, the forest soon gives way to a view of the Wasserkuppe, at 950 metres the highest elevation in Hesse and the Rhön.

            "description_long": "On about 140 km, we hike through the heart of Germany and cross the state borders of Bavaria, Hesse and Thuringia. The experience of nature is emphasised, as a large part of the route runs through the Rhön Biosphere Reserve. The trail begins in the south of the Rhön in Bad Kissingen and then heads north through the Franconian Rhön and over the Kreuzberg. Through the Hochrhön we reach the Thuringian border at Andenhausen. The trail then continues north through the Thuringian Rhön. The trail finally ends in Bad Salzungen. The western Kuppenrhön variant described here takes us through the Hessian Rhön. Some of the many highlights here are the old town of Tann, the Milseburg and the Wasserkuppe as well as the Red Moor. The Hochrhöner also takes us over the highest elevations of the Rhön such as the Wasserkuppe and the Kreuzberg. It passes cultural highlights such as the famous spa town of Bad Kissingen, the Franciscan monastery on the Kreuzberg with its old brewing tradition, the centre of gliding on the Wasserkuppe, the Milseburg and Bad Salzungen with its half-timbered buildings.",

This leads us past the old sheep barn to the red dot path, which shows us the way towards Renzen. At the former sawmill Renzen, we change from the red dot trail to the right onto the circular trail no. 12. We hike in serpentines over the Eichhornshof, Braunenberg and the Strohberg to the edge of the forest and there we meet the \"HW8\" again, which we follow to the left. After approx. 1 km, turn half-right into a sunken path and up to the Wilfersberg heights. We continue on the \"HW8\" and walk to the right along the steep slopes. A little caution is required here. After about 1.5 km, we come to a fork in the road and leave the \"HW8\" to the right to continue on circular trail no. 12. After a few hundred metres, we turn right into a sunken path. The circular trail no. 12 leads us constantly to the right until we reach the edge of the forest, from where we have a very beautiful view of the Steinbach valley. We continue to the Strohberg, where we change to the left onto the \"HW8\". Through the vineyards we reach Untersteinbach and follow the \"HW8\" to the market place and the church. If we pass between the church and the vicarage, we come to the \"Venedig-Brückle\". We pass the sports facilities and the tennis courts and turn right towards the sports home.

The ascent leads across glaciated terrain, where you should watch out for crevasses. Especially in poor visibility, orientation on the Schladminger and Hallstätter glaciers can quickly become a challenge. The route is exposed on the northeast side. The route can be icy in places during the low season, so it may be necessary to bring crampons and an ice axe. Climbing the Randkluft can also be a challenge in bad conditions.",

Past the Söllereck cable car, on the Probstweg, you pass the idyllically situated Freibergsee and cycle through the Stillach and Rappenalptal valleys to the Speicherhütte. A very difficult section begins here, as you have to overcome the well-known Schrofenpass. Anyone who is neither free from giddiness nor sure-footed should not do this tour. The trail continues to Warth. On the main road we descend over the Hochtannberg pass to Schoppernau. There the next challenge awaits you. First on the forest road along the Diedamskopfbahn to the Breitenalpe. On a difficult trail to the Neuhornbach inn, where you should fortify yourself, because the tour is far from over. From the Althornbach Alpe, the MTB must be carried/pushed for approx. 40 min. to the Starzeljoch. Here, a difficult trail also leads down to the Starzelalpe. Slightly ascending on a trail/path, this route takes you past the Obere Lüchlealpe and finally downhill on a \"flowing trail\" to the Stutzalpe. If you have made it this far, you will be given a gentian by the hut host. But you can also treat yourself to several, because the tour is not too difficult all the way back to the starting point.<br/><br/><b>Restaurants:</b> Gasthof Birgsau, Adler (Hochkrummbach), Neuhornbachhaus, Obere Lüchlealpe, Stutzalp and other rest stops along the way<br/><br/><b>Special features:</b> Sliding/carrying passages at Schrofenpass and Starzeljoch<br/><br/><b>Bike Servicesation: </b>Stutzalp<br/><br/>The numbering of the tours corresponds to those in the compass map Rad/Mountainbike \"Kleinwalsertal Oberstdorf\".",

            "description_long": "From the car park \"In der Au\" we walk to the Schweizer Haus and cross the bridge of the same name over the Fränkische Saale. At the promenade path we turn left and walk upstream out of Bad Kissingen. On this stretch we also encounter our trail marking for the first time, a black \"K\" on a golden sceptre, the Karolingerweg. We walk around the Heinz-Kalk-Klinik and come across the graduation building (1), where salt used to be extracted and which is now used as a spa. On the opposite side of the river, the Auwiesen meadows stretch out and we soon see the Bismarck Museum, which is located in the Upper Saline and is worth a detour. Passing the bottling plant of the Theresienquelle, we reach the village of Hausen with its former monastery and immediately cross the Nüdlinger Bach stream at a small bridge and a little later also the Saale. Now we walk along the left bank and reach Kleinbrach. In the village, we turn right into Tränkgasse and walk under the main road. We soon find ourselves back in the Saale valley and walk along a small path through the floodplain meadows. The path describes a bend and leads us across the Saale again at a weir house. On the opposite bank of the river is the Luitpold-Sprudel (2). Healing water has been flowing here since 1912 and we can fill our water bottle with it. We finally walk to the road and under it. Then we keep to the right and at a crossroads to the left. We walk close to the Franconian Saale again and can now already make out the castle in Aschach in front of us through the treetops. At the edge of Großenbrach, we turn left onto a cycle path that takes us to the bridge in Aschach. We hike into the village and have now earned a first rest in the garden of the castle (3). In the centre of the village, we then turn right into Von-Henneberg-Straße, which takes us in the direction of the sports field. We now leave the Karolingerweg and follow the black double triangle that points us to the Premicher Straße. We walk up the hill and past the turnoff to the sports field. After about 500 m we find a signpost to Frauenroth and turn left here. We now walk along orchard meadows and can look back over the valley of the Franconian Saale, which we have walked through. At a crossroads, we enter the forest and walk over the Bauersberg to Frauenroth. We reach the monastery walls at the edge of the village and turn left in front of them. A famous minnesinger is buried in the monastery church (4). In the centre of the village, we turn into the Schmalzmühlweg, which takes us up the hill over a small stream. We cross a crossroads with a crucifix and reach another crossroads with a bench. Here we turn left and have to change to a path on the left at the next bend. This brings us to the Schmalzmühle and we also cross the Aschach here. Continue along the road for a while, which we cross after 300 m and reach Stralsbach via a forest road. In the inn \"Zum Weißen Rössl\" we can now take a longer break and fortify ourselves. We then walk through the village and turn left into the Silberdiestelweg. This leads up to the Hermannsruhe forester's lodge (5). We hike over the crossroads and are now in the Klauswald. Now we follow the yellow triangle on a white background, which takes us down to a wooden cross. Here we turn left and reach the Klaushof with game enclosure, where we can also stop for a bite to eat. Behind the inn, our path now leads along the road to the Kaskadental valley (6). We follow the man-made course of the river until we reach a small covered rest house. Here we turn right and hike down the hill until we reach the Schweizer Haus again. Soon we have reached the destination of our day trip on the left again.",

Soon you reach the romantic Frauenroth monastery church with the touching grave of the minnesinger Otto von Botenlauben. From the resting place under the branches of the mighty hat beech at the end of the village, the Hochrhöner meanders on along the stream and the edge of the forest. A steep descent leads to Premich and offers wide views from the Black Mountains over the Kreuzberg with the transmission mast to the Lange Rhön. The Hochrhöner first follows the valley of the Kellersbach upwards and turns off to Langenleiten, a long street village. For centuries, the Franciscans have compensated pilgrims for the steep climb up the Kreuzberg with their monastery beer. We hikers also appreciate a good sip before the descent to Oberweißenbrunn, our destination.",

Then we continue in constant ups and downs on wide forest roads to the Königsbachalm, where we can fortify ourselves for the onward journey.

There are still almost 600 sweaty and energy-sapping metres to climb. But the magnificent view of the Steinerne Meer, the Hagengebirge and the Hoher Göll from the idyllic alpine pasture around the mountain inn rewards us for our efforts. However, before we set off on the Rückweg after the more than deserved refreshment stop, we should definitely make a detour to the Feuerpalfen. From this vantage point we have an impressive view of the Königssee and St. Bartholomä as well as the rugged Watzmann massif with the famous Watzmann east face towering behind the lake.",

Hier genießt du eine grandiose Aussicht auf die Allgäuer Alpen und in das Bergpanorama ingebettet den idyllischen Engeratsgundsee. Der anschließende Abstieg ist steil, anspruchsvoll und erfordert Trittsicherheit aufgrund steinigem Terrain. Man wird aber mit einem atemberaubenden Weitblick belohnt. Unten angekommen bietet sich die Schwarzenberghütte für eine wohlverdiente Pause und Erfrischung an. Nach einem letzten Abstieg erreichst du das Giebelhaus, wo du die Wanderung bei einer gemütlichen Einkehr ausklingen lassen und den Bus zurück nach Hinterstein nehmen kannst.

This listed and very cosy old town from the Middle Ages is situated on an island where about 3000 of the 22000 Lindau residents live. After Reichenau, Lindau is the second largest island in the \"Swabian Sea\".</p>\n<p>Lindau has a long history and was first mentioned in a document in 882. It used to be a free imperial city. The fact that it survived the Second World War almost unscathed is evident from the many smart old houses. A good example is the Old Town Hall: the magnificent façade, which is still intact, shows scenes from Lindau's history and the German Reichstag, which met in the town hall in 1496. A stroll along the harbour promenade is also recommended. Here, the Old Lighthouse still marks part of the old town fortifications.</p>\n<p>We cycle through small villages such as Bodolz, Taubenberg and Hörbolz towards Degersee and Schleinsee. At the Degersee lido, it's worth taking a leisurely break and jumping into the clear water. The route continues through meadows, forests and small villages - such as Nitzenweiler and Atlashofen - to Kressbronn, which, like Lindau, lies directly on Lake Constance. Important economic factors in this area, apart from tourism, are above all wine, fruit and hop growing.</p>\n<p>In Kressbronn we can visit, among other things, the Museum im Schlössle with its idyllic Schlössle Park, various churches and chapels, the lake garden, the marina and the former farm and sheriff's estate \"Hofanlanlage Milz\". Here you will find an old farm typical of the region, which has been preserved to this day. It offers visitors a true-to-life insight into former farm life.</p>\n<p>We continue along the lakeshore from Kressbronn back to Lindau. On the way, we enjoy the wide view of Lake Constance and can take another break for a swim. </p>",

If we dare to climb one of the high seats, we can enjoy a wonderful view of the surrounding landscape. Shortly before Zell we have to use a very overgrown section of path. Here we must not be tempted to choose another path. After a while, we cross a small tarred road behind the small village. Behind it, the path crosses meadows up to Ziegelstadel. Unfortunately, there is no signpost at the bottom, so we can easily miss the turn-off. If we have walked too far, we can turn left into the forest at the next sharp right-hand bend. After a few metres a small path leads up to the Pfaffenhalderundweg. Follow this to the north until you can end this alternative at a turning loop. This path can also be very helpful if the meadows are impassable due to grazing in summer. From Bad Grönenbach we follow the cycle path along the Kreisstrasse to the railway station.",

            "description_long": "We begin our hike in Kirchdorf im Wald. We first take a look at the parish church \"Mariä Unbefleckte Empfängnis\" (Immaculate Conception), which was built in the Baroque style at the beginning of the 18th century on the walls of a Gothic predecessor building. The interior houses a high altar, pulpit and side altars in rococo style. The showpiece of the high altar is the 1.5 m high figure of the Mother of God from around 1480. Since the High Middle Ages, believers have been making pilgrimages to the place of Mary in Kirchdorf. The pilgrimage is said to have reached its peak during the 30 Years' War, with 15,000 pilgrims a year coming to the miraculous image. It was not until the beginning of the 19th century that the flow of pilgrims slowed down. Today, the only pilgrimage to Kirchdorf is on Kirchweihsonntag, the last Sunday in August, from the neighbouring parish of Innernzell. We walk downhill on the Kirchberg road, where we can already enjoy a beautiful view of the foothills of the Bavarian Forest on a clear day. Further on we meet the road to Bruck. At the sign for the town, turn left onto a dirt road. At the houses of Bruck, we turn left and walk across the sloping terrain to the chapel of Bruck. There we cross the Brucker Bach stream and keep left on the ascending path to Abtschlag in the direction of the forest. We pass a bench and several death boards. The tradition of erecting boards of the dead was widespread in Bavaria, Württemberg, Switzerland and Austria in the 19th century. Today, this form of commemorating the dead is only found in the Bavarian Forest and the Upper Palatinate Forest. Once upon a time, the deceased were actually fixed on them and they were lowered into the grave on them. To commemorate the dead, people redesigned the board after the burial and placed it in the hallway, for example, at a place where the deceased frequented or travelled during his or her lifetime. We continue along the edge of the forest, enjoy beautiful views and orient ourselves towards the nature trail. Through the forest of the Pfaffenberg we finally reach an asphalted road after about 2 km. We turn left towards Abtschlag. At the \"Gasthaus Niedermaier\" we go left, after 150 m we pay attention to the path on the right. After 300 m it leads us past a wayside cross. The path forks before the forest at Grünberg. Here we first walk uphill to the left at the edge of the forest until we reach a crossing path, walk right there and arrive at an elevated tank. Passing it on the right and going downhill again, we keep left at the edge of the forest and walk along the road to the beautiful village of Grünbach. There we turn right at the last house, and after 100 m the path splits into three directions. We choose the path on the far left and walk on it to Gschwendtermühle. In the next village, Fürstberg, the \"Josef Braumandl\" inn invites you to take a break. Now walk uphill to Eppenschlag, cross under the main road and finally turn left along the road into the village. Turn left at the church square before turning right at Marbacher Straße. In Marbach, we keep to the right on the Auenstraße to Sommerau. There we look out for three letterboxes in front of the Klopferbach stream and choose the path to the left uphill. This path leads us into the forest and always uphill until we reach a wide forest path. Here we go left, further up the mountain. At Kohlstatt we come across isolated farms and a sign \"Privatweg\" (private path). Before this, we use the path on the left and walk along the meadow. At the end of the meadow, we keep to the main path and from now on follow the signs to \"5\" and \"Kirchdorf\". We now walk downhill with many changes of direction until we reach Kirchdorf. When we reach the village, we turn right onto Aubergweg and Wilhelmstraße to the church.",

A short distance further on, the next idyllic (rest) spot awaits us with the only periodically appearing Soila Lake. Here we have the opportunity to exchange our bike for mountain boots and climb the Ettaler Manndl or the Laber. Both peaks offer us a gigantic panorama. The view of the Ammergau Alps, the Ester Mountains and the Wetterstein Mountains with the Zugspitze is impressive. To the north, with good visibility, we can even see across the Staffelsee to the Ammersee and the Starnberger See. The return route takes us back to Eschenlohe via Oberammergau, Ettal and Oberau.",

In addition to the wonderful scenic highlights of the World Heritage Run, it is primarily the cultural and historical sights that make the World Heritage Run an unforgettable experience. The starting point of the tour is St. Mark's Square. The St. Mark's House of the same name, the former hospital of the city of Bamberg, is home to a faculty of the University of Bamberg. Besides the monastery of St. Michael, which is situated high above the roofs of the city on the Michaelsberg, the cathedral square with its historic buildings is one of the absolute highlights of this tour. But the Laupassagen along the Regnitz and through the Theresienhain also have their own special charm. The last kilometres of the route take us through the beautiful alleys of the city and across the Maxplatz, the central market and event location of the cathedral city.",

            "description_long": "We start our bike tour at the car park at the fire station in Parkstraße. We cycle to the right on Parkstraße, keeping to the white and black \"R 3\" signs. This way we reach Kißlegg railway station, cycle past it and then come across the through road. Turn right into this road, cross the railway tracks and then turn right again into the Stolzenseeweg. Continue straight ahead, but then turn left in the direction of Stolzensee.\n<br/>After a few metres, we can find out about the \"Kißlegger Seen\" nature trail on a display board: In order to improve the water quality of numerous lakes and ponds, the \"Action Programme for the Rehabilitation of Upper Swabian Lakes\" was launched in 1989. Thus, at intervals of several years, the water is drained to allow the lake bottom to regenerate and to dry out the sludge.\n<br/>We continue cycling straight ahead along the Obersee, which is also called Stolzensee by the locals. It was formed after the last ice age about 16,000 years ago and is almost 16 metres deep. We pass the village of Stolzensee, turn left behind it, cross the Immenrieder Ach and finally reach Rempertshofen. Here we keep to the right and now continue on the new cycle path.\n<br/>In Eberharz we meet a road again, on which we cycle to the right to Immenried. At \"Im Tobel\" we keep right and then left at Maria-Schlegel-Straße. Cross the main road and after a few metres you come to the church of St. Ursula. Behind it, we turn left into Hohlgasse. At the end of the street we turn right into the street \"Zur Holzmühle\". We then cycle along this road to the Holzmühleweiher pond.\n<br/>From there we continue straight on to the Langwuhrweiher pond. Behind this we turn left and shortly afterwards reach the Hasenweiher. At the next fork in the road, we keep to the right and make a short detour to the St. Martin's Church in Eintürnenberg. The origins of this building date back to the 12th century.\n<br/>From Eintürnenberg we now cycle back down along the same path to the fork in the road and from here straight on to the Brunner Weiher pond. We cycle along this to Brunnen. At the small chapel we turn right and finally reach a road. Continue on this road to the right to Holdenreute and from here to the main road. Turn left into this road, pass the Boscherhof farm and reach Wiggenreute. Here we now have the opportunity for a little refreshment in the inn \"Zum Grünen Baum\". There we turn right, pass Höllenbach and then continue on the road to the left. Behind the junction, the Eberhardslinde - a natural monument - stands on an elevation to the left. The tree is named after Prince Eberhard von Waldburg-Wurzach, who is said to have planted the lime tree.\n<br/>A little later we turn right into Le-Pouliguen-Straße. We return to Kißlegg on this road and turn right at the church of St. Anna's cemetery into Alpenstraße and then left into Seestraße. We walk around the Zellersee lake and then meet the road. Here we turn left onto the cycle path, pass the old castle and continue along Espanweg, Jäger-, Herren- and Emmelhofer Straße. This is how we finally reach our starting point again in Parkstraße.",

            "description_long": "We start our circular tour at the market place of Bad Schussenried. From here, we ride straight along Schulstraße and then turn right into Friedrich-Jahn-Straße. On this road we leave Bad Schussenried in the direction of Reichenbach and finally come across Zellerhof Straße. Here we turn left and cycle along the cycle and footpath around the Zeller See (1). Shortly after the Zeller Hof, we keep to the left, following the white-green cycle path sign towards Aulendorf. We now cycle along Langes Holz, keeping to the wooden signposts in the direction of Otterswang. This way we pass the Albert-Uhl memorial bench and the health bench - here we can not only enjoy the unique view, but also do something for the fitness of our knee joints at the same time. After this short stop, we continue cycling along the edge of the forest and reach Otterswang via Toräcker. Here we cycle straight ahead on Meinrad-Von-Au-Straße. At the main road we turn left and after a few metres turn right again onto the road towards Laimbach and Schwaigfurt. On this road we cross the railway tracks and finally reach the boat rental at Schwaigfurter Weiher (2). From here we cycle to the through road in Laimbach. There we continue on the cycle path to the left, following the white-green signs \"Bad Schussenried - 4 km\". Finally, we reach Kürnbach, where we have the opportunity to make a short detour to the Upper Swabian Museum Village (3). The basic idea for the district open-air museum, founded in 1969, was to preserve the old Upper Swabian farmhouses, which could no longer be maintained at their original location. In the meantime, a real village has been created with 26 buildings from five centuries. Our path continues along the road, over the railway bridge to Bad Schussenried-Bahnhof. Here we follow Bahnhofstraße to the bypass. We turn right into this in the direction of \"Biberach - Riedlingen - Bad Buchau - Bad Saulgau\". Finally, however, we turn right onto the road to Olzreute. Here we cycle on to the left on the Laubühlweg - following the white-green signpost \"Steinhausen - 3 km\". We cycle past the Olzreuter See lake (4) and through Lauhaus to the through road. Cross the road and after a few metres you reach Steinhausen. At the pilgrimage church (5) we turn left three times in succession, so that we finally cycle straight on along the Bayerweg. We reach Aichbühl and continue left on the Riedweg. After a few metres, however, we keep to the right, following the signs towards Sattenbeuren. Once there, we continue straight ahead until we reach the road and cross it. Passing the Gfällholz and the top of the Mühlhölzle, we come to Reichenbach. We cycle along the Sattenbeurer Weg until we reach the through road, turn right into it and a little later turn left again into the Kreuzweg. We leave Reichenbach and soon turn left onto the cycle path. This takes us back to Bad Schussenried (6). There we take Saulgauer Straße to the roundabout and take the first exit in the direction of the town centre. This takes us back to the market square after a few metres. From here we now have the opportunity to explore the town extensively - for example, Germany's first beer stein museum: the collection shows steins in all sizes from a total of five centuries. Guided tours of the Bad Schussenrieder brewery are also offered. But the grounds of Schussenried Monastery are also worth seeing - especially the library hall and St Magnus's Church with its choir stalls. In the associated museum we can also marvel at over 800 years of monastery history.",

On this tour we always enjoy wonderful views of the Rofanspitze, the Hochiß, the Hochunnutz and the Guffertspitze.",

At the same time, he built a new toll bridge in Munich and thus diverted the flow of money to the city further south. The Wittelsbach family made Munich their residential city, which has left its mark to this day.\n<p>Back to Marienplatz we take the S-Bahn.</p>",

The Blue Quarry on the outskirts of Ehingen was created at the end of the 19th century when the former Ehingen cement factory quarried material for its production here. A nature reserve since 1980, the quarry provides a habitat for frogs, toads and all native newt species as well as the grass snake and various cricket and dragonfly species. Later we come to the source of the Mühlener Bach stream with fish ponds and a game reserve. Since 2001 it has been freed from its straightening so that the plant and animal communities typical of the region can re-emerge here. The Kirchen valley, west of Ehingen, is of particular scenic interest. Until 150,000 years ago, the Urdonau flowed here (Untermarchtal, Mochental, Ehingen, Schelklingen, Blaubeuren, Ulm). In Algershofen, near Munderkingen, warm springs rise from a depth of more than 170 metres and maintain a temperature of 17 to 18°C even in winter. The springs, which are said to have healing powers, contain sulphur and radon - the picturesquely situated body of water has been used as a bath for over 100 years.",

Here we first have to take a private bus to Hinterstein, from where we then have to take the bus back to Oberstdorf. A timely departure is therefore recommended in order to be sure to catch the last bus from the Giebelhaus to Hinterstein. The Giebelhaus at the end of the tour is a cosy place to stop for refreshments directly on the trail. The ascent route (mostly as a traverse) leads over mostly south-facing, flat and undulating slopes. We reach the summit via a somewhat steeper slope. The descent to the Giebelhaus is on moderately steep to steep south- and east-facing slopes. Orientation is effortless in good visibility. In poor visibility, however, it quickly becomes a challenge.",

            "description_long": "The circular tour starts at the eastern end of Elsenfeld. Directly at the football field is also the Elsavatalradweg, which we will use initially to get to Schippach. By the way, the cycle path is an old railway line. In Schippach we change to the well-signposted \"R\" path, which leads us slightly uphill into the forest. The \"R\" stands for the Maintalhöhenringweg, which encircles the entire Main quadrangle. We leave the \"R\" trail already at the Wittersbach and follow the stream downwards on a\n<br/>wonderful trail to the northern end of Erlenbach. Once in Erlenbach, we cycle along the edge of the forest towards the clinic. Shortly afterwards we already meet the Franconian\n<br/>Rotweinwanderweg, which we will use for our tour as far as the Clingenburg ruins. Above the Erlenbach open-air swimming pool, we climb a few stairs. Shortly afterwards, we find ourselves directly in the terraced vineyards. The first vineyards were probably planted in the 12th century. Red wine is grown here to 80 %. The approx. 180 km of red sandstone walls\n<br/>are listed as historical monuments. Shortly after the vineyards, we cross the wild and romantic Seltenbach valley and reach the ruins of Clingenburg Castle. Destroyed at the end of the 17th century, the castle is now widely known for the Clingenburg Festival. We leave the Rotweinwanderweg (red wine hiking trail) and drive back a short distance and use a forest path to reach the Ringwall with its lookout tower, which stands a good 100 metres above the ruins. Up here, the Spessartbund has erected a large log cabin for\n<br/>erected. It is open on Wednesdays, Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. Incidentally, this hikers' hostel offers a mattress camp for 12 people. Incidentally, the lookout tower can only be entered during the opening hours of the blockhouse. The tower, which is a good 22 metres high, offers a magnificent view of the Main valley some 200 metres below from the viewing platform.\n<br/>After descending from the observation tower, we then head east along forest paths. Shortly after the end of the forest, we catch sight of the long panorama of a mountain range. The well-known \"Donkey Trail\" is located on this ridge. To get there, however, we first have to pass through the villages of Schmachtenberg and Röllbach. Less than 10 minutes later, we are already at the south-eastern end of Röllbach and are driving along the\n<br/>the tarmac cycle path up to the edge of the forest. A little later it turns into a slightly gravelled forest path. At the top we meet the donkey path and use it to the monastery of\n<br/>Engelberg monastery. For the last few kilometres it is a pure single trail. After a few stony sections, the descent begins. Here you should pay attention to the partly loose ground. The trail takes us to the end of the parking area for the monastery. Right at the monastery, you can enjoy the view of the Main valley and be fed by the Franciscans. The fact that it tastes particularly good up here is also shown by the many local\n<br/>visitors. If you go to the Klosterschänke, you should remember that your bikes can only be parked at a considerable distance. In this respect, you should be prepared.\n<br/>For the onward journey, we use the tarred road down into the village. After crossing the country road to Röllbach, we climb a few metres for the last time. Here we also use the\n<br/>Rotwein hiking trail. This time it doesn't take us quite as high up, but it's still enough for a good view. However, we leave it early and descend to the Main cycle path, which will take us back to Obernburg. In Klingenberg it leads us over the bridge\n<br/>to the left side of the Main to Wörth am Main. Klingenberg, Wörth am Main and the old town of Obernburg have plenty to offer for anyone interested in old half-timbered architecture. If you want, you can easily knit together a little sightseeing programme here. The Main cycle path connects all these small towns. To get back to Elsenfeld, we use the footbridge over the Main at Obernburg. The signposted cycle path takes us directly to the Elsenfeld sports facilities, where we started the tour.",

            "description_long": "We choose the spa centre in Bad Königshofen as the starting point for our hike. We walk down the road, leaving the \"Franken Care\" care centre on the right. At the crossroads we come across our first tour marker, the \"unfilled green triangle on a white background\". We turn right onto the atmospheric birch avenue and walk past the beautifully situated Kneuersee, where we can also stop for a while. On the avenue we find some beautiful wayside shrines and can also use the well-trodden path next to the tarred track for hiking. Crossing a small stream, we soon reach the pilgrimage church Maria Geburt, which was built in rococo style, and hike past it on the right. A footpath leads us across the Weißbach stream into Ipthausen. In the centre of the village we find the village museum and walk past it. Immediately we turn left and walk past the country inn to a stone crucifix. Here we find a signpost pointing us to the Merklach mountain hut. We use the right-hand path to the Blankenberg farm, which leads us slightly uphill. We walk past a poultry farm and cross a forest road. Then, after a bend to the right, we walk left into the forest. We are now in the eastern part of the Grabfeld, which was rightly included in the nature park because of its interspersed hills and forests. We now hike a short distance through the Hainholz and reach a clearing. Here we can turn right. This takes us across a meadow to the mountain hut at the highest point of the Blankenberg. Here we can take a first rest under fruit trees and enjoy the beautiful view. We then walk down again and return to the path. This leads us across the clearing back into the forest. Partly through open, hedge-rich landscape with beautiful views, partly through forest, the hike now leads us further through the Grabfeld. The path climbs slightly and we reach an open field, where we walk along the edge of the forest on the right and bypass it. At the edge of the field we discover a signpost pointing us back into the forest. It goes uphill and we reach a small clearing in the \"Merklach\" forest. Here there is a bench with a bank book, where we can immortalise ourselves with a meaningful saying. It is also worth stopping here, as the view of the southern part of the Grabfeld is beautiful. We have now reached the highest point of our tour and hike back down. After a bend to the right, we come to a forest path. Here we walk to the left and discover a seating area at the forest clearing. Here we can take another rest. The view extends over Eyershausen to the Kleiner and Großer Gleichberg mountains in the north. We now walk downhill along the path through the fields and turn right at a crossroads. We reach Eyershausen via the Weißbach stream and walk past the village pond. Here we also find the trail marking that accompanies us on the last part of our hike, the blue \"X\" on a white background. Cross the main road to reach the village church, considered one of the most beautiful in Lower Franconia. Shortly before the village sign, we turn left into the meadow path and cross the Krummengraben. We come to a cycle path and turn right. The path now leads us back along the Weißbach on partly poplar-lined paths. At a bench we leave the Weißbach and walk across an open field to Ipthausen. We reach the crucifix again and walk past the village fountain to the pilgrimage church. Via Birkenallee we reach the spa centre again and this time we can turn right over a small bridge beforehand. This way we reach the car park again via the caravan parks and have reached the destination of our hike.",

Already from the outside you can see why it is called that: The chapel, first mentioned in 1478, was built directly against the 30 m high tuff rock, which thus forms the back wall of the building. As early as the Late Latène period (150/100 BC to around the birth of Christ), the area served as a Celtic place of worship.\n<br/>Now we walk on through the chapel forest to Hohebach to the Jagst bridge and the Jewish cemetery.

At the main road we turn right onto hiking trail 10. A few hundred metres after the water treading pool we come to a fork in the road. Here we deviate from our actual tour and make a detour to the Kalksklinge.</p>\r\n<p>From there we go back along the familiar path, then continue to the left. We soon rejoin trail 11, which leads us uphill to the edge of the forest. Here you have a wonderful view over the Steinbach valley. Now head downhill and then turn left onto a gravel path. We hike for a long time through the forest, always keeping to the right, until we reach the edge of the forest and the vineyards. From here we can see the village of Renzen. The hiking sign „red dot“ shows us the way to the right until we reach the main road of Renzen. Follow this to the right, then cross the Ohrn and then the Landesstrasse.\r\n</p><p>This takes us to Altrenzen, where we keep to the left and continue to the wine village of Heuholz. The old wine press appears in front of us, where wine was pressed in earlier times. Here we keep half-right and get onto hiking trail 12, which we follow up to the „Umsetzer“. From there we have a wonderful view over the beautiful Hohenlohe countryside. In good weather, you can even see as far as the Katzenbuckel in the Odenwald.</p>\r\n<p>We continue üalong the „Rot-Kreuz-Weg“ and hiking trail 12 until, following the „Rot-Kreuz-Weg“, we turn off into a gorge. We come across the sign „HW8“ (main hiking trail 8), which shows us the way to the Strohberg and the Herbenberg. Here we leave the „HW8“ and walk straight on through the village of Herbenberg to Simonsberg (naturist area). At the end of the path, we turn sharply to the right, walk downhill and come across a footpath. Walk down this path to the village of Untersteinbach. When we reach the end of the footpath, we turn right and come to the main road. Continue straight ahead until you reach Fleinersmühlenweg. After another 500 m, we are back at our starting point, the outdoor pool car park.</p>",

Behind the last houses, the area of the city of Munich begins. The Böhmer ponds, already visible in the distance, are to be developed into a landscape-compatible recreation area. At the moment, the former quarry ponds are private land. Swimming is prohibited there. Many scenic stretches in green strips and along railway lines alternate with typical residential areas. Near Langwied station we can overlook the Pasing depot from hills next to the line. Near Blutenburg Castle we come across a memorial to the death march of prisoners from Dachau concentration camp. Blutenburg Castle was first mentioned in a document in 1432, but construction on the grounds began years earlier. The castle is based on a moated castle from the 13th century. The Blutenburg is said to have been destroyed during the Thirty Years' War, but there is no evidence of this. In the second half of the 17th century, interest in the castle waned and activities shifted to Nyphenburg Castle. At this time, the middle house was built first. Already at the end of the 18th century, the castle park was opened to the public. Today you can meet a lot of joggers there in the morning. Opening hours vary depending on the season, but they can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.schloesser.bayern.de/deutsch/Schloss/objekte/ny_schl.htm\">homepage of the castle</a><p>. Next to the palace is the City of Munich Botanical Garden. On the way, two playgrounds invite children to take a break. The two S-Bahn stations we pass on the way mean that the tour can also be conveniently shortened.</p>",

At the railway line we keep north until we cross it through the \"Röhre\". Past the Auwald school and sports centre we reach the Iller. On the other side, after a few metres, we are at the Rauhenzell quarry ponds. We continue to follow the cycle path signs to Rettenberg. After the old centre of Rauhenzell, we soon cross the B19. Through an avenue of birch trees we reach the main road and follow it eastwards on the cycle path. Birch trees line our path until we reach the roundabout below Rettenberg. To the right and left are some beautiful mosses. In a long curve we overcome the difference in altitude to Rettenberg.  Behind the church we turn left at the butcher's shop and the bakery. Again, a larger incline awaits us. As we now ride a little higher via Sterklis and Engelpolz to Emmereis, there are many views of the charming valley. Opposite the church, a path takes us down to the Emmereiser Moos. We continue southwards to Acker. Behind the houses we follow a road through small woods and past meadows to the Geratser waterfall, which we can visit just 2 minutes off our route. Shortly before Rieder we cross the Kranzegger Bach stream. After the short ascent, we use the Keisstra;e OA6 until shortly before Greifenmühle. From the hikers' car park we follow the old salt road to Rottach. Some rapid descents demand our attention to stay safe on the uneven ground. In Rottach we can pay a visit to the beautiful church of St. Antonius Einsiedler. Afterwards we drive on the district road via Gindels and Humbach to Freidorf. We cross the village and turn off towards Untermaiselstein. There we can buy delicious mountain cheese, Emmentaler and other dairy products at the alpine dairy during opening hours. Behind Untermaiselstein we drive through the meadows to the new B19. Along it we reach the Untere Zollbrücke. From there we follow the old B19 into Immenstadt. At the first roundabout we turn left, cross over to Klosterplatz and are soon back at the starting point of the tour.",

Even in the first metres of ascent after the cemetery, we are offered fantastic views over Immenstadt. Further up, we can see the entire Illertal valley all the way to Kempten. From the fork in the path to Alpe Oberberg, we see the Upper Illertal and the Allgäu Alps spread out before us. At Bärenkopf, a plaque points out the last bears in the region that were shot up here. On the descent to Gunzesried, we get to know the fascination of the valley of the same name, where numerous thrillers have been filmed. Above the village, we hike through an old hollow alley, which used to be used by horses to supply the higher alps.<p/><p>The Haldertobel, through which we descend towards Blaichach, impresses with its flora.

On warm days, the pedestrian zone is full of people who settle down with coffee and ice cream in the many small cafés and enjoy the day.\r\n</p><p>The cycle tour from here to Lake Constance takes us along many small villages, through wide fields and some forest tracks. In between we can take a short break at a lake and at the latest when we reach Lake Constance it is worth jumping into the refreshing water.\r\n</p><p>In Kressbronn we can visit the Museum im Schlössle Kressbronn, which has a dozen wooden ship models. Also interesting is the cable bridge over the river Argen, which lies near the marina. Built in 1897, it is the oldest German bridge of its kind and is said to have served as a model for the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.\r\n</p><p>In Friedrichshafen, which enjoys an international reputation thanks to its trade fair, airport and large industrial companies, we are attracted above all by the expanse of Lake Constance. Here we can stroll along the harbour, enjoy the view of the lake and take a look at the nearby old town. A visit to the Zeppelin Museum on the lakeside, which houses the world's largest collection on the history of aviation, is highly recommended. The centrepiece here is the huge partial replica of the airship „Hindenburg“ complete with cabins and passenger rooms.</p>",

            "description_long": "<p>The tour starts in the Konstanz Stadtgarten. If we still have some time before the tour, it is worth taking a walk through the old town of Constance, which we can reach in five minutes on foot. Its historic town centre was hardly destroyed during the wars and so the Mediterranean lifestyle, the mild Lake Constance climate and the small alleys of the student town blend to make it a very popular holiday destination. On a clear day, you have an unforgettable view of the lake and the snow-covered Alps behind it from the lakeside. During the bathing season, you can always take a dip in the refreshing water during our tour. <br/>In Radolfzell we can take a detour into the old town, which is well worth seeing. Radolfzell was founded as early as 826 by Bishop Radolf of Veron. On a short tour of the town, it is worth taking a walk across the market square, through the historic centre of Radolfzell with its very old houses, as well as a look at the old Gothic church and the Minster of Our Lady. We can take a short break in one of the many cafés.<br/>We leave Radolfzell along the lake promenade in the direction of Moos. In Moos we cross the very beautifully situated Ried along the Radolfzeller Aach.<br/>On our way to Stein am Rhein we cycle through nature reserves, past small hills, beaches, orchards, through vineyards, along beautiful half-timbered houses and many expansive and sometimes very colourful fields. <br/>Stein am Rhein would be the perfect place for a film set, because it is not for nothing that it is known as one of the most beautiful places on Lake Constance. Numerous colourful half-timbered houses adorn the medieval townscape. The town hall and the monastery on the shore, also dating from the Middle Ages, are not to be missed. We buy a typical Swiss fondue in a shop on the market square. In one of the many inns or cafés we end our tour in a cosy atmosphere. To get back to Constance, we have several options: Either we take the train to Konstanz, one of the boats at the harbour to Kreuzlingen (the Swiss border town right next to Konstanz) or we cycle back to Konstanz on the other side of the Untersee. For this stretch we extend the tour with „Untersee 2 (Lake Constance): On the Swiss side from Stein am Rhein to Konstanz“.</p>",

Shortly before the small village of Spielmannsau, you enter the wild Traufbach ravine. A rocky path leads up along the rushing stream. At the upper end of the ravine we emerge from the shade of the Bäume, then it is not far to the Traufbergalpe. The alp was first mentioned in 1333 and was permanently inhabited at that time. Today the small hut makes a rustic, cosy impression. The last stretch up to the alp is very steep, but once you reach the top, the impressive view of the high Krottenspitze, under which the Traufbach rises, the Fürschießer, the Muttlerkopf and many other high peaks is worth the climb.\r\n<p>After a long rest with delicious bread on the alpine pasture, we start on the Rückweg. We decide against the descent through the ravine and instead continue along the steep slope of the Traufberg. At the highest point of the trail there is a beautiful vantage point where we can take a short breather and enjoy the view of the ravine below us. Then we descend again on the other side of the wooded slope. Once we have reached the bottom of the Trettach valley, we are soon back in Spielmannsau, where we can stop for a break if necessary.</p>\r\n<p>From Spielmannsau down into the valley, we follow the road above the Trettach. Passing the small Christlesee lake with its clear water fed by snowfields, we then return to the starting point of our tour in a relaxed manner.</p> <p",

We follow the path in the direction of the barrage and now join the Altmühltal cycle path. After passing Oberau, we pass the stalactite cave Schulerloch (2). We stay on the Altmühl until we reach the football pitch and then cross Altessing on Schellnecker Str. We continue straight ahead on various village roads out of the town. At Einthal we change to the opposite side of the road and cycle directly along the Altmühl. On the right we now see Prunn Castle (3) perched on a huge rock high above the landscape. We follow the route along the course of the river and cross it on the first bridge in Riedenburg (4). By following the road for 400 m, we leave the Altmühltal cycle path and join the equally well signposted Schambachtal cycle path. This runs level and close to nature along a former railway line between Riedenburg and Ingolstadt. We cross the Schambach at the junction to Frauenberghausen and return to the right bank of the river in Neumühle. On the main road we pass Hexenagger Castle (5) and cross Hexenagger. Now the idyllic Schambachtal awaits us: gentle river meadows and lush green meadows and forests characterise the picture. Via Leistmühle and Hanfstinglmühle we reach Altmannstein where we can visit the castle ruins. We follow the Schambachtal cycle path through Sollern and Neuenhinzenhausen, cross Landshuter Straße in the direction of Sandersdorf and reach Oberdolling after a few kilometres. Here we cross Friedhofsstraße and turn right into Tholbatherweg. On the perfectly passable railway line we cycle through Kösching and Lenting. At the end of the town we stay on Ingolstädter Straße, which becomes Beilngrieser Straße in Oberhaunstadt. Once in Ingolstadt, we turn right onto Roderstraße, cross the railway tracks and then turn left towards the historic old town (7). We cross the Main-Danube Canal on Donaustraße and continue straight ahead to the destination of our tour, Ingolstadt main station. However, those who still have excess strength can alternatively cycle along the canal back to Kelheim (approx. 30 km).",

We want to reach the summit, however, and to get there we climb another 200 metres. A short, wire-rope-secured stretch leads to the summit over a rock step, so sure-footedness is required here. The majority of this technically quite easy tour leads through forest, which promises us good views of snow until well into spring.

            "description_long": "We start our tour at the market place of Erlbach and walk on the Eubabrunner Straße out of the village. On the left of the road is a small pond, behind which we turn left into Waldstraße. Parallel to the Stockrauhbächel brook, our route leads towards a piece of forest and right along the edge of the forest until the last houses of the street \"Waldhäuser\" can be seen on the right.  Here our path enters the forest and\n<br/>goes straight on until it reaches the German-Czech border, which we follow on the left. Now we first go downhill to the Julius stone, a border stone from 1544 with the coat of arms of the Electorate of Saxony and a Bohemian lion, and then steeply uphill again to the Hinterer Kegelberg, the highest point of our \"mountain tour\". At the summit, we turn left and descend through the Kegelberg ski area to the former forest restaurant. In serpentines, our path now winds its way back along the border up to the Luchspöhl. We follow the state border until we reach the Drei-Rain stones, which mark the border point between the former dioceses of Naumburg, Regensburg and Meissen. Here we leave the border in a westerly direction and hike downhill into the Landesgemeindetal. Following the Floßbach stream, we pass the Hintere and Vordere Floßteich ponds, both - as the name suggests - witnesses to the former timber rafting in the Vogtland. Near the Vorderen Floßteich is the Tannenmühle, a former paper mill that now houses a children's home. Now we go uphill to the right to the Gopplasgrüner Berghäuser (mountain houses), from where we enjoy a magnificent view of the village of Erlbach and the Schwarzbach valley. Then we descend to the district of Gopplasgrün, turn left there, turn right at the end of the village and reach a stream. Cross the stream and walk parallel to it along the edge of the forest to the right. At the last houses of Gopplasgrün we come to a T-junction, where we turn left and then left again at the next junction. Continue straight ahead on the Mittelweg up to Spornreuth, a former execution site, where a plaque commemorates the last execution in 1823. After we have mastered this last ascent, we walk through the fields down to Erlbach and return to the market square, our starting point, via the street Am Sommerberg and Kirchstraße.",

            "description_long": "We first cycle in the direction of Edlhof and turn - over the railway tracks - onto the cycle path to the right. Here begins a steep ascent on a forest path. After a while we arrive at the height and emerge from the forest. Now the road climbs gently and we cycle through the fields to Schörgendorf. We cycle through the village and on a narrow asphalt road to Wingersdorf. There, the König-Max-Höhe is the highest elevation in the region. At 520 metres above sea level, we have a fantastic panoramic view over the countryside. We rest a little at the rest area and discover the memorial stone. This was erected in memory of the visit of King Maximilian II of Bavaria in 1852. Just like us today, he had enjoyed the expansive view back then. We cycle over the crest of the Max-Höhe and turn left towards Kellberg down the slope. From a distance we can already see the onion domes of the parish church of St. Blasius and decide to visit it. Construction of this church began as early as 1400. Stones from Erlenstein Castle, which had been destroyed a few years earlier, were used as building material. The late Gothic building has been renovated again and again over the course of time, but the basic structure has been preserved until today. The side altars and other works of art are also worth a look. Next to the main church is the Leonhardi Chapel. It is dedicated to the hermit and abbot Leonhard. In the chapel we learn that the village of Kellberg lies on the old trade route for graphite earth and salt, which leads from the Kellberg area to Passau. After the visit, we cycle through the village back onto the \"Donauperlen cycle path\" in the direction of Fattendorf. The road is now somewhat wider and leads steeply downhill. At a fork, we turn left onto a narrow road to the Schaibing railway station. At the crossroads, a picnic area and a shelter invite us to linger. We cycle past the old Schaibing railway station and gently follow the stream up the slope. We pass the old paper mill and the Schmölz farm and turn right onto a path. This is the old dam on which a narrow-gauge railway ran until 1969. It transported the graphite mined in the Kropfmühl mine to Schaibing. In 1972, the railway line was converted into a hiking trail. We pass the Aubachmühle mill and cycle a few kilometres through a sparse mixed forest. Behind the Wastlmühle, a geology nature trail has been set up along this stretch, which tells us about the structure of the subsoil in the region. In Kropfmühl we come out of the forest and continue to the mining museum. It shows us a former winding plant and we visit a gallery and the old shaft building from 1916 next to the main building. Finally, we continue cycling on the road via Leizesberg and Ziering to the village of Schaibing. There we meet the \"Donauperlen-Radweg\" again. Via Rothenkreuz we cycle to Rackling. About 1 km behind the village we could cycle on the asphalt road via Niedernhof directly to Obernzell. But we decide to turn left after Steinöd. Behind the farm, we drive down the slope across a meadow and turn into the forest via Niedernhofer Leite. This path leads us down a steep forest path to the Eckersbach stream at the Hammermühle. From here we cycle along the course of the stream on a narrow asphalt road to Obernzell. Directly on the Danube we come across the prince-bishop's castle of the village. Nowadays it is home to a ceramics museum. We cycle across Obernzell's market square and turn onto the Danube cycle path behind the town exit, which takes us to the marina. We take a look at the boats and treat ourselves to another stop before we cycle back to Eger along the cycle path.",

            "description_long": "<p>The Danube Cycle Route is one of the most popular cycle routes in Europe and is one of the absolute \"classics\" - after all, the Danube is the second longest river on the continent after the Volga. It rises in the Swabian town of Donaueschingen and after 2860 km later flows into the Black Sea, crossing Central and Southern Europe along the way.<br/>This tour describes the route from Passau to Vienna. Historical places, a very varied landscape and highlights such as the Schlögener Donauschlinge, the Benedictine Abbey of Melk and large parts of the Wachau will be passed during our journey. The stages are divided in such a way that we have enough time for all the sights. Finally, we reach Vienna and thus the cultural highlight of this tour.<br/>The Danube Cycle Path is generally well signposted and the paths are pleasant to ride as they are mostly flat and well built.</p>",

After about 100 m we cycle steeply up the road to the left until we turn right at the hotel inn and then immediately left again along the B309 in the direction of \"Oy-Mittelberg/Kempten\". At Gschwend we turn left in the direction of \"Wertachmühle\" and at the third junction left again in the direction of \"Feriendorf Reichenbach\".  After reaching the main road, we cycle a little to the right on the opposite side until the road begins on the left in the direction of \"Haslacher Alpe\". Below the Haslacher Alpe, we keep left onto the gravel path towards \"Jungholz\" and at the next fork in the road we cycle right towards \"Stubenthal-Alpe\" to Tirol. On the descent from the Stubenthal-Alpe, we follow the asphalt path and only after just under 300 m do we turn left downhill onto the gravel path in the direction of \"Pfronten/Vilstal\". The path turns into a path and ends at a forest path, which we follow downhill to the right in the direction of \"Pfronten\". At the trail triangle in the Vilstal valley, we turn left towards \"Pfronten\" and head out of the valley past the Vilstalsäge inn. Shortly after the Vilstalsäge, we cross the bridge over the Vils on the right and ride left along the stream to the Schochersäge. Here we now take a sharp right turn, follow the path into Himmelreich and continue towards \"Schönkahler\". At the next junction, we then take a sharp left towards \"Fallmühle\". Before the main road, we turn left again onto the cycle path along the Steinacher Ach to Pfronten-Steinach. We follow the cycle path signs, reach Pfronten-Ried and finally Röfleuten. Continue on the \"Einfängweg\" in the direction of \"Pfronten-Kappel\". Still on the route signposted as a cycle path, we pass the village and cross the main road at the northern end of the village. On the right of the B310, the path now begins in the direction of \"Rehbichel\". After crossing the railway line, continue straight ahead for a short distance and then turn left at the second turning towards \"Hertingen/Nesselwang\". We cycle through the hamlet, reach the main road in the direction of \"Nesselwang\", cycle on this road to the entrance to Nesselwang and from there cycle right through the village back to our starting point.",

Here we change to a footpath and then to a forest path, via which we reach the ruins of the Stork Tower. The view from there is impressive. You can see the monastery and far into the Jagst valley. Follow the unpaved forest path into the stork forest. A short time later, a paved forest path turns off to the right and is again marked with a red cross. Follow this straight ahead along the eastern edge of the steep \"Schelmenklinge\". Then the path leads us into the fields and on to Rossach past the children's playground and cemetery. A driveway branches off to the left and brings us to circular trail no. 7, which comes from Jagsthausen. We follow it in a southerly direction to the left onto the district road and to the edge of the forest. At the emergency call pillar, we walk left onto a forest path. The trail descends in serpentines into the \"Schelmenklinge\". Before we reach the edge of the forest, a steep path branches off to the left and takes us up the forest slope. From the top we have a magnificent view of the Berlichingen church. The unpaved path passes above the Storchenturm (stork tower) and at the edge of the forest we rejoin the grass path marked by a red cross, which takes us down the steep slope back to our starting point, Schöntal Monastery.",

In Achen, we go straight on at the first junction before turning left about 100 m after passing the Argen bridge. Now we follow the side road with little traffic until we reach the through road, which we cross with caution in the direction of Schwanden. Continue on the narrow side road until you reach Schwanden, which you cross in the direction of Haubach. Once there, we go straight ahead at the crossroads and follow the signs towards Beuren. The Haubacher Steige now demands a lot from us, but after about 2 km we reach Beuren (1). Here we follow the main road to the crossroads at the church, where we keep to the right. After 300 m turn left again towards Allmisried/Winnis and follow the narrow road. In Allmisried we have the opportunity to refresh ourselves in the Badsee natural swimming pool (2), which is directly on our route. We set off again on our way. 500 m after Allmisried, our route branches off to the left in the direction of Enkenhofen. Now we ride for 2.3 km on a wonderful panoramic path over the heights of Badsee, where we can enjoy a wonderful panoramic view (3) of the lake and the surrounding mountain ranges. In Enkenhofen, we keep to the right at the first and second crossroads and finally reach the side road towards Uttenhofen. About 2 km after the end of Enkenhofen, we turn left in the direction of Schönenbühl, which we finally reach after about 800 metres. In Schönenbühl we keep to the right. At the next crossroads we turn right. A winding, partly steep descent awaits us, which finally leads to a crossroads. At this junction we turn left, and at the following junction we turn left as well. Soon we reach the Argen bridge (4) and 20 m after crossing it we reach the main road. Cross the main road and head towards Blideratzhofen (5). We cross this village and continue straight on in the direction of Christazhofen. In Christazhofen we turn left towards Isny. 20 m after the church we turn off again, this time in the direction of Unter-/Oberharprechts. Following the signs, we reach Oberharprechts after a good 2 km. Here our route branches sharply left - we follow the signs towards Isny/Sommersbach. We cross the Argen again, 400 m after the bridge we turn right towards Unterried. Finally, in Unterried, we keep left towards Isny/Neutrauchburg. Stay on this road for the next 1.5 km. Immediately before the beginning of Neutrauchburg, just after the bus shelter, we leave the main road to the right, where we pass through a moorland area on a beautiful path back to the residential area of Isny. Here we continue to the main road, where we keep to the left. Now you have the opportunity to make a detour into the old town (6), which is well worth seeing, and where you can also stop for a bite to eat. Finally, we continue to the roundabout, where we turn right in the direction of Achen and after a few metres we arrive back at our starting point at the old railway station in Isny.",

If you use the cable car to Füssener Jöchl, the metres of ascent are kept within limits. The location of the Tannheimer Hütte or the Gimpelhaus is ideal for stopping off after the most difficult part of the undertaking with an excellent view. The exposition of the trail is mainly south to east facing. Orientation is easy. The route is well secured, but very slippery when wet. Inexperienced via ferrata climbers and children should definitely take the appropriate via ferrata equipment with them. If you choose the variant described here with the descent via the Gimpelhaus, either park a car in Nesselwängle and drive back to Grän or keep the bus times in mind to get back to the starting point after the tour.<br/>",

After a stop at the Obere Schwande alpine hut, we return past the Ro&szligberg alpine hut to the turn-off towards the Sattelhütte/Dreiangelhütte. At this junction, a short stretch of gravel path begins, which later turns into a small path. In between, we have to negotiate a short sloping passage over steps. Finally, the path ends at a fence. A wooden scaffold makes it easier to cross with the bike on the shoulder. Then the asphalted road begins again in the direction of „Sattelhütte/Dreiangelhütte\". Soon you are tempted to take a 700 m detour on the left to the Sattelhütte. From there, the tour takes us back along the road to the left, continuing in the direction of the \"Dreiangelhütte\". The main road is called \"Königssträßchen\". Take a sharp right turn, follow the signs to \"Dreiangelhütte\" and after a further 3 km you will reach the Dreiangelhütte. Here you can make another stop for refreshments. Continue on the \"Königssträßchen\" and soon take the turnoff to the left in the direction of \"„Winkel/Berghofer Waldalpe\". On the Rückweg to Winkel, the Waldalpe invites you to take a last rest. The actual Rückweg leads us along the asphalt path, slightly up and down, until it finally goes steeply downhill to Winkel and the car park at the cemetery.",

            "description_long": "Our circular hike starts directly at the Franconian Saale, where there is also an information board with the circular hiking trails of the region. The tour leads us to the old town hall of Aura. Directly next to the building, a cross path leads us up to the parish church of Sankt Laurentius (1), the former monastery church of the Aura monastery. We follow the circular hiking trail with the \"2\" on this section. There is a wayside shrine behind the cemetery. Walk past it and continue up the hill on the meadow behind it. We walk along the edge of the valley and through orchards with a wonderful view of the valley of the Franconian Saale with the Trimburg ruins in the southwest. The slopes along which we are now walking were once vineyards. At a pasture fence, our path turns up to the left and we reach a forest path. We walk along it a few metres to the left, then turn right and already see the \"Ruine Aura\" inn in front of us, adjoined by the walls of the same name. Here we can take a rest and also have a closer look at the remains of the monastery building that was never completed. At the ruins we find a signpost pointing east towards Euerdorf, marked \"RA1\". We now follow it and walk past a cattle pasture to the edge of the forest. We cross a forest road there and now walk on a wider path through the Hainbuch. On a level stretch, our hike now leads through copper beeches and we leave the field of vision of the Saalegau for a few kilometres. At Männerholz, we cross a forest road and continue straight ahead through the forest, past a small statue of a saint, until we meet a forest road that slopes down. On it, we go downhill for a few metres to a crossroads. Here we turn right and hike out of the forest on a paved gravel path. At the beginning of the meadow, there is a wooden table and benches (2) on the right, where you can stop and take a break. The trail continues across orchard meadows to Euerdorf, which we can already see ahead of us in the valley. We reach the village via the Alte Kissinger Straße and walk down to the Fränkische Saale and cross it at the old Saale bridge. On the river bank (3) there are benches for resting and an information board for hikers. Opposite, we can stop at the Wolz inn and fortify ourselves for the return march to Aura. In front of the gatehouse, turn left into Ringstraße and walk up to the Willibrords Chapel (4) at the cemetery. Via Bahnhofstraße we finally reach the centre of the village. At the fountain on the market square, we walk up Hammelburger Straße, which brings us in front of the parish church of Sankt Johannes (5) in Euerkirchen. We turn right in front of the church into a small alley, walk along a path to the ring road and cross it. Now we reach the Franconian Saale again. We leave the town on the left side of the river. Our path now leads us across the floodplain back towards Aura. We hike through the very quiet and scenic river landscape and once again enjoy the magnificent view (6) of the Aura monastery church and the old vineyards. Via the Wässerungsweg (watering path) we reach the main road in Aura and cross the bridge over the Fränkische Saale to reach the car park again and the destination of this beautiful circular walk. We can now stop off at the \"Zur alten Brauerei\" inn, directly at the car park in Aura.",

            "description_long": "The railway line from Kaufbeuren to Schongau was closed down in the 1970s. Kaufbeuren then acquired part of the track and had a cycle path built on it from Kaufbeuren to Sachsenrieder Forst. The 17 km long section takes the cyclist past the villages of Mauerstetten, Linden, Aufkirchen and Osterzell, where there were railway stations. Since only steam locomotives were at home on the railway line, this cycle path is also called the steam locomotive cycle path. It is part of the approx. 80 km long steam locomotive circuit, which leads from Sachsenrieder Forst via Ingenried, Burggen and Bernbeuren to Lechbruck, where it meets the former railway line from Marktoberdorf. The Damplokrunde follows this via Roßhaupten and Stötten am Auerber to Marktoberdorf. Via Biesenhofen the starting point Kaufbeuren is reached again. We use this cycle path, signposted with a locomotive, as far as Burggen. There we turn north and follow the Lech downhill via Altenstadt, Schwabniederhofen, Hohenfurch, Kinsau and Epfach to the B17, which we follow to Landsberg am Lech. On the way to Burggen there are very interesting views of the Alps.\r\n<p>Habratshofen was a small hamlet in Sachsenrieder Forst, which is still commemorated by the old well. In the 19th century, the area comprised 642 acres of land. There were 18 people living in the three houses. When the meagre living conditions deteriorated further, Habratshofen was abandoned. The Bavarian state bought the land and had the area afforested.</p>",

            "description_long": "This easy bike tour takes us to the Memminger Lande. Except for a very short stretch, we are on little or hardly used side roads throughout and cycle a good part of our tour on a former railway line that has now been converted into a cycle path. Our starting point is at the Karthäuser See lake in Buxheim - a very popular local recreation destination for Memmingen's recreation seekers. However, we ignore the beach café at the beginning of our tour and immediately head south on our bikes. After crossing the bridge, we cycle half left uphill at the large crossroads, past the Buxheimer Weiher (1). Through a large wooded area, we first keep half-right, then right again, before following the signposting \"Brunnen\" to the right. Shortly before the village of Brunnen, we reach open terrain again and follow the asphalted farm track. This path takes us to Brunnen, where we turn left and immediately right again and enter a short forest area again. Here we follow the path to Altammann, which we pass through. When we reach the road at Kiefer, we keep to the right and follow this road under the motorway to Ferthofen. Here we can take the opportunity to make a detour to the dam wall of the Iller reservoir - but in the village we orient ourselves to the right in a southerly direction and arrive at Kardorf on the side road with some incline, where we continue in a southerly direction. In the following section of the route, we again have the opportunity to make a detour to the Iller, the Iller dam Lautrach (2) offers us impressive perspectives on the right. Soon we reach Illerbeuren, where we immediately come across the signs to the Farm Museum (3). The visit to the very attractively presented museum is the highlight of this cycle tour. After about half of our tour, the short break is certainly a welcome change. The Swabian Farm Museum in Illerbeuren invites us to visit and take a tour through the history of Swabia. With more than 30 buildings from four centuries, it is not only the past that comes alive here. In the museum grounds, houses and farms furnished in period style and many interesting facts on all topics related to rural cultural history await visitors. The Swabian Rifle Museum is also attached to the Farm Museum. After we have been sufficiently informed (and fortified), we make our way back to Buxheim. For this we choose the district road uphill, paying special attention to the traffic on this short section of road: we share the ascent with motor vehicles and drive accordingly carefully. Once on the hill, we follow the signposts to the left \"Fahrradweg Memmingen\" into the forest. Through the forest we always follow the signs in the direction of Memmingen. By the way, we are now on a former railway line that led from Memmingen to Legau since 1912 and was converted into a cycle path after the train service was discontinued. And so we follow the tracks of the trains through the Memmingen countryside, pass Dickenreishausen (4) and stop shortly before the motorway bridge. Here we have the opportunity to make a detour into Memmingen city centre (5). If we want to return directly to the starting point, we keep to the left and follow the Haldenweg, later the Talstraße always straight ahead, before we come through Buxach to Buxheim. Now we turn left twice more and are already back at the starting point. After our efforts on the bike, we have earned a refreshment at the lido at Karthäuser See!",

Since this not only sounds like a major undertaking, but is one as well, anyone who doesn't trust themselves to cover the almost 77 kilometres at first go should think about stages. The tour can easily be split into a 2-day tour with an overnight  stay on one of the Alps. What defuses the whole tour, however, is the fact that there are no particular cycling challenges on any section.

            "description_long": "Our tour starts at the Mauth car park. A field path leads to the edge of the forest, from where a path branches off to the left into the Wei&szligbachschlucht. This is only for walkers, but we still dare to take a short look into the narrow gorge. We go back and follow the forest path from which we turned off before. Along the Weißbach we now walk, mostly under shady Bäumen, to the village of the same name. Just before you meet the main road, turn left. After 200 m you come to a T-junction, turn left and cross the Wei&szligbach stream. Can you already see the playground? Now it's time for a bit of a romp before we move on to the next adventure station, a bar footpath. What can you find with your feet? We cross the stream again and walk to the left, very close to the bank. Can you spot the wooden figures at the side of the path? After another 700 m, we finally cross the Reiterweg and meet the Inzeller Stra&szlig. Along the country road you pass the small village of Nagling. Behind it, turn left and walk along a narrow footpath for a while. You pass the Trift Monument, which provides interesting information about the transport of wood on the water in earlier times. Large quantities of timber were once transported into the valley here. Can you hear the loud roar in the distance? These are the white water streams, which rush down a steep slope and impress us not only with their sight but also with their loud roar when the water level is high. When the water level is low, the brave can get really close to the waterfalls over the slippery rocks. Who wants to risk a little shower on a hot summer day?\r\n<p>We carefully cross the main road and on the other side we come across the remains of a historic brine pipeline, one of the oldest of its kind. Passing the pipeline, we hike uphill along the path and shortly afterwards encounter the <b>Glacier Garden</b>. Here the traces of the Saalach glacier, which dominated large parts of the region during the Ice Age, are still clearly visible. Particularly interesting are the traces of the so-called glacier mounds, a geological peculiarity. You can see cylindrical holes in the rock, sometimes up to 1 m in diameter, which were formed by swirling masses of water during glacial melting.</p>\r\n<p>Now follow the signs to Weißbach to the right. On this path you will come across the remains of the old brine pipeline and finally the \"Himmelsleiter\" (ladder to heaven), whose 420 steps lead you back down into the valley. Back at the main road, we then hike back along the familiar path to Mauthäusl.</p>",

Two rustic huts invite you to stop here again. If the already magnificent view of the Chiemgau mountains with the Hochries and the Mangfall mountains with the Wendelstein is not enough for you, you can climb the Kranzhorn and/or the Heuberg on foot. From the two summits we can let our gaze wander as far as the Wilder Kaiser and the distant Großvenediger. We finally return to the valley via partly very rough paths.",

On the left we see the late medieval fortified church (1), whose white fortified towers have distinctive stepped gables and red gable roofs. On the uphill stretch, we leave the village area on the Kapellenweg (chapel path), which runs below wooded hills along the Altmühl. The numerous side arms of the quiet river run through the idyllic wet meadows of the valley incision, which soon loops to the left. In a gentle up and down, we reach Pfraundorf with the beautiful Kratzmühlsee (2), on whose northern bank we turn right and cross the Altmühl. In the shadow of the imposing Mühlleite, which rises up on our right, we continue to Kirchanhausen, where a bridge takes us back to the left bank of the river. Here the valley widens to reveal the resort town of Beilngries, which we reach via beautiful green spaces and fields. In the centre we turn right and pass a monastery (3) before we cross the Altmühl on the Ingolstädter Straße (B299). We continue straight ahead for a bit before turning left along the glider airfield (4). We then cycle through the idyllic meadows of the meandering Altmühl to Kottingwörth. Here we change to the other bank of the river. The river valley running in a north-easterly direction becomes visibly narrower again here. Soon we reach an open plain where Dietfurt spreads out. The recognised health resort is crossed by the Mühlbach, the Breitenbrunner Laber, the Weiße and the Altmühl, all of which flow towards the Danube. We cycle through the town area and around the Wolfsberg, where old Celtic ring walls have been preserved to this day. We cycle along a former railway line, which then takes us through the church village of Mühlbach to the Main-Danube Canal. This runs through a narrow valley that leads us in a tight loop to Riedenburg. In the tranquil town, which is nestled between the surrounding hills, we change banks twice and then continue in an easterly direction. We pass below Prunn Castle, which can be seen from afar on a steep limestone cliff. The originally baroque castle complex now combines a wide variety of architectural styles, including late Gothic and Renaissance elements. Now we have to overcome a small hilltop, behind which we pass Felsenhäusl (5), which houses the prehistoric museum with a fossil collection and exhibits from the last Ice Age. The route then flattens out again and runs through Essing to Kelheim, where we cross the Danube on the Maximiliansbrücke (6) and reach the railway station - there we have reached the destination of our tour.",

Soon the former small railway line branches off to the right, leading us into the meadows with a side view of the impressive Falkenstein Castle (1). The path climbs gently through lush meadows past a shelter, while alley-like trees accompany us along the way. With the woods of Pönholz, a gentle descent slowly begins, which leads us to the country road on the right and out onto the grassland. We pass Winkling and Schergendorf before we reach Gfäll. Here the trail continues slightly uphill and below the church (2) past the old railway station with its wooden facades. Afterwards, another pleasant descent begins, which takes us through idyllic countryside to Schillertswiesen. Here you will also find an old railway station, which today offers an excellent opportunity for a short rest with its shady pavilion. The route then heads north along the foot of the Wachtberg through a section of meadows and fields, followed a little later by the wooded hills of the Hochholz. On a winding route we reach Hirschenbühl, where our route crosses the federal road and leads to Ro&szligbach. Behind the tranquil village we enter the forest again and leave the area of the Upper Bavarian Forest Nature Park. Our route now descends steeply into the Wenzenbach valley. We pass the small village of Lampertsnaukirchen with its privately run railway museum park. In a fast descent we reach Hauzendorf and a little later Erlbach, where again a beautiful pavilion awaits us. After long passages with green meadows, the tree population now increases noticeably again, while we follow the Wenzenbach into the village of the same name, which is already announced to us from afar by the red roof of the Wenzenburg (3). We pass through the village via Unterlindhof and follow the railway line past Irlbach until it ends in Gonnersdorf. Here we change to the Böhmerwaldstrasse, which takes us into Regensburg via the district of Wutzlhofen. After a short ride along the railway line, we turn right onto Donaustaufer Strasse, which takes us across the Regen and the Danube into the district of Stadtamhof, which lies on an island in the middle of the river. Here you will find the Spitalgarten (4), one of the most beautiful places to stop in the cathedral city, where you can enjoy regional specialities and a view of the Danube. Finally, the Stone Bridge leads us to the Old Town, which has been designated a World Heritage Site and which has earned the nickname \"Italy's most Mediterranean city\" for its small, Mediterranean-style arcades. Finally, we reached our destination at St. Peter's Cathedral (5), which dominates the cityscape.",

            "description_long": "The guest information office is also located at the spa administration. We turn left into Rathausstraße until we reach the roundabout. There we turn left into Safferstettener Straße and drive past the spa hotels to Safferstetten. The municipality of Safferstetten, together with the towns of Würding, Egglfing and Aigen am Inn, has formed the large municipality of Bad Füssing since 1971. At the Heilig-Geist-Kirche (1) we follow the signs \"Schwalbe\" which will accompany us the whole tour. Bad Füssing is said to have had a total of six farms in 1937, when oil and gas were being searched for in the remote town on behalf of the Reichsbodenforschung. Instead, the drilling crews found spring water with an unpleasant odour at a depth of about 1000 metres and a temperature of over 50 degrees Celsius. After the war, spa operations began and soon more springs were drilled. Today Bad Füssing is one of the most famous spas in Germany. We leave Safferstetten on the Jägerweg, to the right of the \"Hotel am Mühlbach\", after 300 m we cross under the Innsbruckstraße and ride in open countryside on the cycle path to the Pichl Chapel (2). Here we turn left in the direction of Egglfing. We reach the district of Bad Füssing on Thierhamer Straße. We make sure that we turn right at the next junction after the crossroads with the road to Irching. The signpost with the swallow can be found at the village entrance sign. Our path leads us first through fields, then along an old arm of the Inn. At a junction to the left, we ride through the meadows towards the dam path on the Inn (3). We can decide whether to ride on the top of the dam or whether we prefer the path at the foot of the dam. Both paths lead in a westerly direction. On the dam path there are also several information boards that provide information on the flora and fauna of the area. The nature reserve \"Unterer Inn\" is a paradise for birds. Tens of thousands migrate through the area every year on their way south. The main observation time is October and November. After about 3 km, a path to the right of the river leads us to Aigen a. Inn. Through orchards we reach the village of Aigen a. Inn on the Dammweg. At the Bauerngasse we turn left. Attention: for once we pay no attention to the swallow signs here, because the shortcut is indicated here. We stay on the Kesselbrunnweg and continue on quiet side roads via Hainschwanger and Aufhausen to Voglarn, the point furthest west on this cycle tour. In Voglarn, we use the path to the right at the bus stop and cycle to Wendlmuth. There, at the chapel, we turn right to the Riedenburg forest. We cycle along the edge of the forest to Hart, cross a road there and continue to a place called Geigen. Here the road turns at a right angle to the north, we follow its course until we reach a wider connecting road at a gravel pit. We turn right there towards Kirchham. At the first crossroads in Kirchham (4) we decide to take the road to the right and head towards Irching. Drive through the small hamlet of Zanklöd until you reach the edge of the forest 50 m behind the village. There we choose the narrow feeder road to Holzhäuser, but pass Holzhäuser on the left, then meet the main road from Kirchham to Egglfing, go straight on and in Pichl we meet the chapel we passed earlier today. On the left we see the extensive golf course (5) of Bad Füssing. The 18-hole course was opened in 2002. We cycle back to Satterstetten on the same cycle path we came on. We pass the Heilig-Geist-Kirche (Church of the Holy Spirit) and cycle back along Safferstettener Straße to Bad Füssing town hall.",

From now on, our path follows the continuous signage, a yellow sign with a white directional arrow and the inscription \"Grassau und Rottau im Chiemgau - www.laeuferseminar.de\". On a small bridge with wooden railings, we pass the Grassauer Bach stream turning left.

The path leads us through a forest and moor landscape to an interesting information board on the \"Kendlmühlfilzen\" nature reserve (1). This raised bog is one of the most valuable in Central Europe. Together with the Rottauer Filzen, the Kendlmühlfilzen (\"Filz\" = Bavarian for \"moor\") form the complex of the \"Southern Chiemsee Moors\" with a total area of 1800 hectares. Although it was intensively farmed until the 1980s, it still has the original surface form and plant cover in its core area. Shortly after the information board, we leave the moor circuit for a worthwhile detour to a viewing platform (2). In front of the platform you can see the remains of the railway network built from 1920 onwards. The transport of the cut peat by narrow-gauge railway was a basic prerequisite for the cultivation of the moor. Thus, a special peat station was established in Rottau on the Munich-Salzburg railway line. In addition, here you have a good overview of the moor and enjoy a magnificent panorama. We return to the moor circular path and now hike through the middle of the moor. Again and again, benches invite you to take a break. Soon the path joins another one, which we follow to the left. Now the route leads us along the edge of the moor through some woodland. This is followed by a short field passage until, at the level of the hamlet of Klaus, we turn right again towards the moor. Now the Moorrundweg and the Moorlehrpfad Rottau-Grassau run together for a while. Interesting information boards provide information about the flora and fauna in the moor, but also about the aspects of cultivation. A wooden footbridge leads a short distance into the area, which is otherwise off-limits. We then leave the moor and cross the German Alpine Road, briefly turn left on the path running parallel to the roadway and then turn right. On a slight uphill stretch, we walk through the forest until the moor circular path turns off to the left. However, we continue to the right and make a detour to a waterfall (3) of the Grießenbach stream. To do this, we have to cross the stream to the right over a wooden bridge and then follow the path further uphill to the left. You can take a breather on a bench and watch the natural spectacle. Back at the moor round path, we now continue to follow the yellow signs with white direction arrow. We hike on paths and trails slightly uphill through the forest until we meet a forest road. This leads us downhill to the left and meets a road at the former mountain bath. Here the \"Bergbadstüberl am Krötenteich\" (4) invites you to take a break. The road takes us further down the valley until we meet the Rottacher Straße. The road leads us to the right and back to the starting point at the tourist information office in Grassau.",

            "description_long": "We start our hike in Mulfingen. Past the school centre, the reservoir hall and the sports grounds, we hike into the Roggelhäuser valley. We do not go all the way to the dam, but turn half-left shortly before to walk along the reservoir to the pre-dam. Here we keep half-left again and follow the Roggelhäuser Bach stream. After about 500 m, we come to an ascent in the forest on the left that leads us to Ochsental. In the village, follow the signs towards Zaisenhausen. Further on, we can make a detour to the honey well before hiking steeply uphill to Zaisenhausen. In the village, we turn left before the St. Nepomuk bridge and follow the grotto path to the Lourdes Grotto, the largest grotto complex in southern Germany. After visiting it, walk back a little and cross the St. Nepomuk or Ette bridge in the direction of the Staigerbach stream. Old stone bars along the way remind us of the early wine-growing in this region. Continue through the Altenberg development area towards the Staigerbach valley, which you reach after 2 km. There we turn right and after 50 m immediately left into the Pfingstberg forest. A little later, we cross the main road or above the ebm.papst company. Then we follow a dirt road that turns off to the right 30 m downhill.\n<br/>On reaching the juniper heath, we can enjoy the beautiful view over the Jagst valley. Approx. 100 m after a sharp left-hand bend, we turn sharply right and walk up the hill towards Hollenbach. We come across the Löhleinsberg resettlement farms and turn left there. A little later we reach Hollenbach. Here we look at the 1000-year-old lime tree by the church before we walk past the Feinauer building yard through the Rißbach valley towards Ailringen. We pass the Rißbach dam and walk downhill along the stream to Ailringen. At the entrance to the village, a path branches off to the right and takes us over a short climb to the left to the cemetery. The special feature of this resting place are the wooden crosses. After a short detour to the historic town hall, we head through Ailringen towards Mulfingen. At the Mühlbeck company, first turn right over the Jagst bridge and then half-right up to the forest adventure trail, at the end of which we turn left and head downhill onto the Jagst valley cycle path. In Mulfingen you can visit the pilgrimage chapel of St. Anna.",

During the Peasants' War, the \"Veste Prunnekke\" was occupied and plundered, then served as a residence for some time before falling into disrepair after 1691.\n<br/>In the further course of the hike, we move from the Middle Ages to Roman times by following the Limes for a short distance. Along this section we can not only look at the foundations of Roman watchtowers, but also visit a reconstructed border tower. It is the only reconstructed Roman watchtower in Bavaria and was built in 1992. A memorial stone near the tower marks the further course of the historical Roman border system.\n<br/>In Titting, the former moated castle awaits us. It already existed in the 13th century, has an irregular octagonal ground plan with two towers and today houses a brewery specialising in wheat beer. In the Breustüberl we can taste the result.",

It was founded in 1978 and covers an area of approximately 210 square kilometres. The national park not only aims to protect individual animal and plant species, but also to protect nature as a whole. Further goals of the protected area are the scientific observation and research of natural communities as well as the education and recreation of its visitors. It contains the Königssee, the largest body of water in the area at 521 ha. It has been able to retain its drinking water quality to this day. On its banks lies the small village of St. Bartholomew with its famous baroque church of the same name. The settlement first served the prince and canons of Berchtesgaden, later the Bavarian kings as a hunting lodge. The destination of the hike is the 1600 m high Funtensee, the \"coldest\" place in Germany. Here, at Christmas 2001, the lowest temperature ever measured in the Federal Republic of Germany was recorded at -45.9 °C. It remains unclear whether the forest-free environment is due to grazing or to the cold at this location.\n<p> </p>",

In any case, the entire Pongau lies at your feet and the panorama up to the peaks of the Hohe Tauern is indescribable.

The German-Austrian border between Bavaria and Tyrol runs close to the village, which was named \"Bavaria's most beautiful village\" in 2001. More precisely, it runs across the Kranzhorn. This is a 1368 m high mountain on the western edge of the Chiemgau Alps. The Kranzhorn belongs to the municipality of Nußdorf am Inn on the German side and to the municipality of Erl on the Austrian side. For this reason, the summit of the mountain bears two summit crosses. It is visible from far away in the Inn valley and also offers a good view of the Wendelstein in the west and the Wilder Kaiser in the south. The mountain is one of the most popular destinations in the Chiemgau Alps. On our way to the Kranzhorn we circle the Kitzstein, one of the four peaks of the Heuberg. In terms of scenery, this tour offers some highlights with the far-reaching view from the Kranzhorn and the flora and fauna rich in species from the Kitzstein. From a technical point of view, the 35.2 km long route, which is mostly covered on gravel paths, does not pose any major challenges, but some sections near the Kranzhorn are very steep.\n<p> </p>",
